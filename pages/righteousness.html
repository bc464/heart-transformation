    <h1>Righteousness versus Self Righteousness</h1>
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Self Righteousness</i><span>-</span> To see one's own bad attitude
        and heart. To ask God to come and deal with me first.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Self Righteousness</i><span>-</span>To see the pride on one's own
        heart, which does not allow one to see one's own faults and which
        prevents one from forgiving.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Righteousness</i><span>-</span>To have integrity, purity of heart,
        correctness in thinking, feeling and acting. We can only have
        righteousness in Jesus who is our righteousness, that receive by faith
        in Him
