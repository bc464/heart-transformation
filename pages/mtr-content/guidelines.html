        SUGGESTED GUIDELINES FOR MEMBERS OF THE MINISTRY TEAM OF A TOUCHING
        HEARTS MINISTRIES
      </h3>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Isa 61. We are instruments in hands of the Holy Spirit. For us to
            get out of the way, so that the Lord can do His work, we are there
            to serve others in the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord, what a
            privilege! To pray for cleansing before any meetings, with the Blood
            of Jesus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intercession. 30 to 15 minutes before the meeting to prepare the
            ground. Vitally important! Remember to ask the Father where He would
            have you sit, to be sensitive to Holy Spirit to intercede during the
            meeting. ("om op jou pos te wees.). During the week to be sensitive
            to pray for needs in the group, if the Lord gives you a Word for
            someone to phone and encourage them.
          </li>
          <li>
            For monitors to remind the group that it is only ministry team that
            would be ministring to the group, as we want folk to relax and
            receive to the full for themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the prayer at end of video, for the monitor to lead the time
            of ministry, to be waiting on the Lord, being sensitive to what the
            Holy Spirit is doing, to operate in the gifts of the Holy Spirit
            with the team.
          </li>
          <li>
            When praying for people, the ministry team should be aware of the
            following:
            <ul>
              <li>Don't pray loudly, just keep it gentle</li>
              <li>
                Not to comfort them (Holy SPirit is the Counselor) don't rub the
                person on back, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Not to counsel them (Holy Spirit is the Counselor) not
                discussing things with them (give it all to God)
              </li>
              <li>Not to push them over! (God's power will do it).</li>
              <li>
                At the end of ministering to someone, ask the person if there is
                still something specif they are trusting God for (briefly). If
                they are deeply engaged with the Lord not to interrupt them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Just gently pray for the Holy Spirit to fill, fall upon, blow
                upon or be poured out on the person, to wait on Jesus praying
                quietly in tonques, and minister into the revelation that He
                gives (Word of knowledge, Discernment, Vision, Prophetic word or
                Scripture) if the Father does not give any revelation, to
                encourage the person to give to Jesus whatever He may lift up in
                their hearts, and to pray into that.
                <b
                  >Not to pray intellectual or soulish prayers, Whatever you do,
                  if He does not give revelation, then just continue to pray
                  quietly in tongues and release the anointing, to bless what
                  God is blessing and doing. </b
                >Jesus will show you through the type of anointing as to what He
                is doing, healing, deliverance, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                To be praying in teams of 2 or 3 people, one of the team being
                ready to catch the person if they were to fall - be alert and
                ready! See that they are covered acceptably. Ensure they will be
                safe if they were to fall.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pray for them for a while, after they respond to the Holy Spirit
                in some way, there can be falling, tears, laughter, shaking,
                etc. or there may be no visible Holy Spirit manifestation, to
                move on when Jesus tells you.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a fair amount of time goes by and nothing seems to happen,
                suggest that they give to Jesus whatever He may lift in their
                hearts, and to stay in the attitude of receiving and soak for a
                while. Sometimes God may show you what He is doing other times
                He won't.
              </li>
              <li>
                If people around you, are irreverently watching and laughing, or
                being noisy, ask them if they wouldn't mind either to be
                receiving for themselves, or to talk quietly, so as not to
                distract others who are engaged with the Father. Help maintain a
                quiet worshipful atmosphere in which the Holy Spirit can
                strongly minister to each person. Even of some of the
                manifestations are noisy and dramatic, don't you introduce
                anything of the flesh with the sacred things that are taking
                place.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don't delay praying with people, or stand around talking to each
                other, each time you finish with one person, ask Jesus who He
                wants you to pray for - let's be efficient, attentive and
                respectful, ministering to all who God brings our way with His
                love and gentleness, that Jesus may be glorified.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you are unsure about their salvation, ask if they are saved.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a large group is waiting for ministry and there are few team
                members try not to spend TOO long with a person praying with
                the.
              </li>
              <li>
                When people are on the carpet receiving, please don't move them
                or disturb them or allow their friends or family to disturb them
                in any way. Encourage them not to be in a hurry to get off the
                carpet and to work together with the Holy Spirit whatever the
                Holy Spirit lifts up in the heart to go with that. To soak like
                a sponge and only to get off the floor when the Father is
                finished. Often folk get off the carpet too guickly. Don't
                disturb the person if out on the carpet, be led of God when to
                share revelation.
              </li>
              <li>Ladies should be appropriately dressed.</li>
              <li>
                If they battle to receive - to have attitude of "I want to yield
                to you Jesus" - like woman who pressed through crowd - to relax,
                not performance, and receive by faith. The capcity to receive
                will vary from person to person. Things can block one to
                receive: want to be in control of life; unconfessed sin;
                grudges; anger in heart toward God; judged work of Holy Spirit;
                charismatics; is Jesus really Lord?; etc. (would have to be led
                by Jesus to discern). They would need to repent.
              </li>
              <li>
                Respect their dignity; they are not an object of ministry.
                "Father what is your heart for this person?" Ask Him to give you
                His heart of love and compassion. It is a privilege to minister
                to His body, and beloved Bride!
              </li>
              <li>
                As Christ leads to lay hands on, in a way that does not sistract
                or embarrass the person, on the head or shoulder if opposite sex
                to get those on team of the same sex to lay hands on, or get one
                being prayed for to lay hands on themselves and to lay your hand
                on top of their hand.
              </li>
              <li>
                Encourage those that do not come forward for ministry at the end
                of the meeting, to be quietly receiving for themselves, and
                drinking in the Holy Spirit and letting Him deal with whatever
                He brings to the surface. Not to be in a hurry to go home! Only
                to go when Jesus says they are done!
              </li>
              <li>
                Start the meeting promptly! If you don't, people become lax
                about being on time! Also encourage people to be punctual!
              </li>
              <li>
                Ministry requirements to be remembered:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Submit your revelation to the team leader, not to pray what
                    you have received. The team leader will discern when and how
                    it is to be ministered.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Remember we cannot control someone with our revelation, it
                    is to be submitted to the person being prayed for : eg, if
                    there is fear to sandwich a negative between two positives.
                    eg. "His perfect love comes to drive out fear. If there is
                    fear and that witnesses with you to give it to Jesus. To lay
                    it down at the cross of Jesus, to repent and receive His
                    forgiveness, to receive His love into the place of fear,
                    because He loves you, you can trust Him fully." Remember to
                    turn a negative into a positive, to minister life into it,
                    ask Jesus for the wisdom every time. Not to say, "thus says
                    the Lord".
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It is important to work with the person's will, where they
                    can engage with the ministry, not to pray at them. Get the
                    person to release things to God, not to do it for them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When submitting a revelation to the team leader, to do it in
                    such a way that the person being ministered to does not hear
                    it, or become distracted, draw the team leader to side and
                    whisper in their ear. If the person were on the carpet, not
                    to talk over the person, but come to the side to share
                    revelation with leader.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If it does not witness with the person, not to force it on
                    them, but encourage them to give it to the Lord Jesus and He
                    will confirm it, if it is of Him. We can all miss it, to
                    keep an attitude of submission.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Please not to wave the dream books and notes of "word of
                    knowledge" around, have it at the side of room to use as a
                    reference, remember it is not to be used as a doctrine, pray
                    about revelation and to have it as a confirmation, it is
                    just a guideline.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Don't distrub the person if he/she is out on the carpet; be
                    led of God when to share revelation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the person starts to share his/her heart, encourage
                    him/her to give it to the Lord Jesus, not to share it with
                    you, and then to pray about it rather than talk about it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the person does not get breakthrough, the team leader
                    should share it with the monitor, to make an appointment at
                    the TH Healing Centre.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The team leader should remember to ask team members if they
                    have received anything from the Lord Jesus.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Remember the covering prayer with the blood of Jesus at the
                    beginning of the meeting and to seal off at the end of the
                    meeting, coming against backlash and pray that the bllod of
                    Jesus would cover any open doors that there may be.
