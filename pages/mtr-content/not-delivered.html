      <h3>WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT DELIVERED</h3>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <ul>
          <li>The person does not really know Jesus</li>
          <li>
            There is no faith that God is able or willing to heal and deliver.
          </li>
          <li>There is no belief that Jesus wants to heal the person.</li>
          <li>Life is out of balance - in disorder or spiritual chaos.</li>
          <li>Bitterness and unforgiveness.</li>
          <li>Unresolved pain or guilt.</li>
          <li>Praying for the wrong thing.</li>
          <li>
            The person believes that "Christians can't have demons" or is
            possibly under a spiritual covering that holds such a view.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is unconfessed sin which the person is wanting to keep hidden.
          </li>
          <li>Ungodly soul-ties and still in place.</li>
          <li>
            There is occult powers in place whose control has not been broken
            either in the person or in those with whom there is a close linking.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is little or no annointing in the place of ministry - due to
            uncleansed ground, building or organisations.
          </li>
          <li>Curses or sickness or death are still in place.</li>
          <li>
            Generational sin and / or demonisation has not been dealt with.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is an inner brokenness through trauma and deeper healing is
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>The person is living in denial of the real problem.</li>
          <li>The person has made inner vows which need to be renounced.</li>
          <li>
            The person is in disobedience over something God has already told
            them to do (which they are not agreeing to.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The ministry team need to seek the Lord for specific revelation
            about hidden demonic controls affecting the individually concerned.
          </li>
          <li>The person doesn't really want to be healed.</li>
          <li>Person is not under Godly authority.</li>
          <li>Lack of discipling in the local church.</li>
          <li>Legalism</li>
          <li>Blocked memories that need to be released.</li>
          <li>Passivity</li>
          <li>
            The ministry team are not in a right relationship with each other
            and are blocking the annointing.
          </li>
          <li>God's timing.</li>
          <li>
            The person is suffering from a sickness that is unto death and needs
            to be prepared to meet the Lord.
          </li>
        </ul>
