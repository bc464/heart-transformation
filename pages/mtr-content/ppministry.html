      <h3>PROPHETIC PRAYER MINISTRY</h3>

      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Prophetic Prayer Ministry is a specific calling requiring a unique
          gifting and not all people called to become monitors are called to be
          involved in prophetic prayer ministry. Those that are released to lead
          a team will be operating in the context of a mini-healing centre, in
          ministering in more depth to those that have not received breakthrough
          within the meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prohetic prayer ministry is linked to prophetic counseling. However we
          don't call it counseling. The training for prophetic prayer mininstry
          takes a lot longer +- 1 year( 1 to 4 years). It is not overnight
          training!
        </p>
        <p>
          The best form of training is coming alongside and learn from either
          Caroline or a monitor that has been released to lead a prophetic
          prayer team, these things are caught than taught. It is a more
          in-depth and specialized ministry. I believe the Touching Hearts
          Healing Centres will begin operating when ever the ministry is
          operating and will develop very naturally. It can have as many teams
          operating as the Lord leads.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a monitor or team member is ready to be released then they can
          lead the second team, which can be developed into a third team etc.,
          so that a healing centre can develop in a very natural way. The 2nd
          and 3rd teams will operate in the healing centre where the lead
          monitor can be available to ooversee the ministry that takes place and
          be available to support and help if necessary. Some monitors may be
          called to be part of a prophetic prayer ministry team, but may not
          necessaruly be called to lead such a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a ministry we do not give our blessing for ministry team members to
          be counseling outside the meetings. If they see that folk are needing
          counseling or more in depth ministry, they are to encourage them to
          make appointments with the lead monitor (or their pastor or local
          churches) and come along with that person and be part of the team
          ministering to such a person, because they are not equipping to
          operate in PPM. We as a ministry cannot sanction it or take
          responsibility for it. PPM is also somehting that doesn't take place
          within the TH meetings. It is a different ministry! Not every monitor
          and ministry team member is called to PPM. No amount of training may
          necessarily prepare one for it, because it simply is not one's
          calling.
        </p>
        <p>
          It does not just depend on gifting, but also the ability to work with
          people, because generally it is caught not taught. That is why I don't
          spend a lot of time teaching on it as the MTR and owuld like to
          encourage those that want to be involved with it to come to be trained
          by Caroline or the lead monitor, in their area, that has been released
          for PPM. Monitors
