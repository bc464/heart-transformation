        <p>EVANGELISM</p>
        <p>
          We are living in such critical times, "the harvest is ripe but the
          labourers are few", so let's pray for a
          <b>passion for lost souls.</b>
          <i
            >"Making the very most of the time [buying up each opportunity]
            becuase the days are evil."</i
          >(Eph 5:16). For monitors and team members to be open and led by the
          Holy Spirit to use the opportunities that He gives us to bring the
          lost to Christ.
        </p>

        <p><b>Within the 11-Day or 18 Week Touching Hearts Course.</b></p>
        <p>PROPHETIC PRAYER MINISTRY</p>
        <p>
          Healing Centers: People receiving ministry outside the meetings. Those
          that don't get breakthroughs within meetings make appointments with
          monitors, to take the person to the TH Healing Centre, or own local
          churches for more in-depth ministry.
        </p>
        <p>MISSION MINISTRY</p>
        <p>

          opened. Paarl-East. Youth and children.
        </p>
        <p>PRISON MINISTRY</p>
        <p>
          This is a huge door that the Lord has opened. We need more people to
          help us, as we could be many teams going in ministering. We will be
          training teams in the prisons so that the course can be run from
          within the prison.
        </p>
        <p>YOUTH AND CHILDREN'S MINISTRY</p>
        <p>
          A developing ministry, will also train youth teams that can work among
          the youth.
        </p>
        <p>OVERSEAS MINISTRY</p>
        <p>
          The Lord has opened doors and is developing the ministry in many
          different countries of the world.
