          <li>GENERAL OVERVIEW</li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Spirit of Jezebel is more involved than the notion of a
              singular spirit that is easily identified. It is in fact a
              principality that functions in the area of
              <b>repentance</b> (sacrifice yourself, repent and then accept
              righteousness).
              <i
                >Jezebel will try everything to prevent you from repenting and
                receiving righteousness.</i
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              It becomes a dog chasing it's tail and the victim is caught
              between the pit of <b>self-righteousness</b> and the pit of
              <b>self-condemnation</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Jezebel is not only active in an individual, but can be active in
              a family, in a community, and also in the Church.
              <b
                >Jezebel is the daughter of Babylon. In essence anyone who is
                seduced by Paganism will open the door for the Spirit of
                Jezebel.
                <i
                  >(in the seven churches in Revelation we see the seven phases
                  the Church went through. See teaching on Roman
                  Catholosism.)</i
                ></b
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Immediate discernment of Jezebel is often difficult as it always
              hides behind a <b>seductive veil</b> of self-righteousness
              <i>(perfection).</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>discernment of a Jezebel spirit</b> will usually come from
              the evidence of a <b>wake of destruction</b> around that
              individual. This is most obvious in how they
              <b>destroy life</b> in those around them, especially their own
              families.
            </li>
            <li>
              Another trait is how the initial veil of being very righteous is
              manipulated to <b>justify perversion</b> of truth. Any opposition
              to a Jezebel spirit, results in <b>being rejected</b> from that
              circle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jezebel is the <b>DEMON OF SHAME</b>(ROOT).
              <i
                >Shame can only exist where there is no repentance of sin. Rom
                10:10</i
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              The 4 basic needs of the Spirit of Man are a hunger for
              <b>FELLOWSHIP, INTIMACY, AUTHORITY,</b> and a sense of
              <b>BELONGING.</b> All spiritual bondage will erodes the victim's
              capacity to satisy the <b>craving for intimacy.</b>
              <i>(Intimacy is a want for unconditional love.)</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              Intimacy = Jezebel tries to confuse the circles. The last circle
              is covenant ground. There are only 2 covenants = our covenant with
              Jesus and the marriage covenant.
              <p><i>NB: Love the sinner, not the son.</i></p>
              <p>
                <i
                  >Sexual curses work hand in hand with Jezebel. Cannot give and
                  receive unconditional love. They are unable to receive
                  forgiveness of sin. Shame comes in.
                </i>
                A person cannot receive forgiveness because of shame.
              </p>
              <p>
                A person who is living under a Jezebel spirit builds walls
                around himself and Jesus cannot get in there:
              </p>
              <p>
                <i
                  >Covenants ground begins when we are placed on the Rock when
                  we accept Jesus in our hearts.</i
                >
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              The open door for the spirit is when the victim believes the lie
              that they are not worthy. In plain language, the first lie of
              Jezebel is that <b>"You will never make it"</b>. Strangely enough
              the last lie of Jezebel is that
              <b>"You are the only one who has made it."</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Like all demonic influence it is <b>fear driven</b>
              <i
                >(begins with Paganism, God is a God of wrath, you have to do
                something-perform)</i
              >. The mind of the victim spends many hours being obsessed with
              the problem of being worthy before God. Jesus said, "Fear and
              axiety and not of Me". <i>(Fear towards person.)</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              Jezebel always uses the <b>tongue</b>
              <i>(spirit of seduction, perversion and rejection)</i> to do its
              work. The soothing tongue to <b>seduce</b>
              <i>(frog in cold water)</i>, the lying tongue to <b>pervert</b>
              <i>(half truth)</i>, and the scatching tongue to
              <b>reject</b>(spirit of rejection)
              <p>

              The Jezebel spirit is a continual and elabirate dance of the above
              three <b>SEDUCTION</b> <i>(to compromise), <b>PERVERSION</b> </i>
              <i>(a lack of knowledge)</i> and then <b>REJECTION.</b>

            <li>
              Destroy: covenant by emasculating the <b>High Priest</b>.(Who
              Jesus really is), tries to destory covenant with Jesus. Jezebel is
              a destroyer of covenant ground.
            </li>
            <li>
              Destroy: <b>the Lordship of Jesus</b>. (avoiid understanding of
              who Jesus is) by seduction into compromise with Paganism.
            </li>
            <li>
              Destroy: intimacy, by substituting <b>true worship</b> with hollow
              worship. To hold the multitudes captive, powerless and enslaved.
              (Fear of rejection. Rejection always goes with Jezebel. Rejection
              is a mighty weapong. We cannot take authority if we have not
              overcome rejection yet. We cannot become a leader if you have the
              fear of man (the root = fear of rejection)).

              makes use of the half-truth to convince you of its bona fides (The
              Catholic prayer the Hail Mary).
              <p>
                The scatching tongue that strips you of your dignity before men.
                It is the fear of this rejection that gives the Jezebel spirit
                its power to enslave.

            <li>
              <b>The veil:</b> Jezebel will always hide behind a veil of
              perfection in the eyes of men. It is always a veil to hide its
              true motives, and is extremely seductive in its appeal. The victim
              will build this veil because of fear. The fear that the shame of
              their sin will be revealed to man. It is rooted in their own
              insecurity that they are not worthy. (Shame leads to
              perfectionism) They live by the ethic that the end justifies the
              means. NB Any direct challenge on the ethnics of their logic will
              be met with a barrage of perverted twisting of the facts. There is
              total refusal to see the evil in their behavior. They deflect the
              attack by creating doubt, making continual use of half-truths
              (perversion), and to scapegoat (blame) others. (Capitalize on the
              fact that you don't have all the facts.) They often walk from the
              counselor's challenge "smelling like roses."
              <p>
                <b>CHALLENGING THE VEIL </b> IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE TAKEN
                LIGHTLY. THE CHALLENGE MUST BE MADE WITH ADEQUATE PROOF AND
                WITNESSESS IF POSSIBLE.

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Handling the Ace card:</b> Use wisdom, and know that sexual sin
              will surface sooner or later. Don't be shocked like the rest of
              the world.
              <p>
                More importantly, realize that it is a symptom of the bondage,
                and not the cause of the problems (<i
                  >root - lack of intimacy). More often than not the counselor
                  will take this red herring and run with it, only to find that
                  after many failed attempts on the part of the victim to
                  reform, he/she loses hope and they fall back into
                  self-condemnation (<i
                    >broken and not under the covenant of Jesus Christ</i
                  >
                  ).

                Just where Jezebel wants them to be!
              </p>
              <p>
                Exposure of secret sin is in fact a precious opportunity to show
                unconditional love. It may well be the first time the counselor
                experiences unconditional love. When he/she sees it in you, they
                might be able to accept that Jesus loves them unconditionally.
                That their righteousness come as a gift from heaven, and that
                all they have to do is accept this in faith.

              <b>The Curses: </b>
              <p>
                Destruction of <b>covenant ground</b> and the erosion of ego
                boundaries, makes the victim dysfunctional when it comes to
                satisfying the need to form intimate relationships. This in turn
                opens doors for other curses in their lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sexual perversion, infidelity in marriage, whoredoms,

                The endless <b>quest for self-righteousness</b>, can lead to

              <p>
                Lying, critical spirit, religious spirit, mistrusting nature,
                and slander (skinder). Always projecting their own failings onto
                others. <i>(rebellion, jealousy, witchcraft, anti-christ)</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                The pressure to <b>keep the veil intact</b> in the eyes of men
                can open doors for other curses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obsession with being seen as a leader, a manipulative spirit, a
                lack of single-mindedness in their dealings, always seeking to
                "divide and rule". It is usually a case of confused leadership
                where the agenda of the leader is never clear to all concerned.

      <h3>THE ROAD TO IDOLATRY</h3>
      <p>
        Matt 21:44 tells us about
        <b>the stumbling stone of truth that will break men.</b> Jesus Christ
        who offers salvation by faith and not by works, and thus asks that
        <b>human pride be humbled</b>(1 Pet 2:6-8).
      </p>
      <p>Jezebel capitalizes on those who stumble.</p>
      <p>
        In fact the spirit goes further, it goes out if its way to
        <b>deceive many into stumbling on the rock of truth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >"For I bear witness that they have zeal for God, but not according to
          knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking
          to establish theit own righteousness, has not submitted to the
          righteousness of God." For Christ is the end of the law for
          righteousness to everyone who believes."(Romans 10:2-5).</i
        >
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          It was this stumbling block that Christ taught about in his parable
          about the labourers in the vineyard. Paul in his letter to the Romans
          pleads to their congregation that they pray for the Jews, because this
          was a major stumbling block for them. In Paul's letter to the Hebrew
          he devotes much energy to explaining the old and new Covenants. He
          also explains in detail the role of the high priest. <br />
          Religion and ritual being with it a lie. It is the lie of Jezebel. It
          is the lie that salvation is earned by religiosity and good works. The
          word says this about salvation: (Rom 10:9-10) <br />
          "...that you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in
          your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
          For with the heart one believes unto righteousness (accept it as a
          gift), and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for Satan to place this stumbling nlock before someone, he
          has to first convince you that you cannot go before the throne of God.
          <b>This is true</b> if you have not yet done what is required of you:
          namely that you accept in your heart and confess with your mouth that
          Jesus Christ is Lord of your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take notice Jezebel's tactice: first tell a half-truth - that God is a
          Holy God and cannot associate with sin, but it is not true that we are
          saved by our works & make ourselves righteous before Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the half-truth has been accepted, then the laborious task of
          constructing a veil of self-righteousness begins.<br />
          This elaborate veil will exude much good intention. Good works,
          voluntarily going without etc. The only problem is that it persues the
          Law. A task that is impossible to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          They stumble on the Rock, they stumble on Jesus, and they fall into
          Jezebel's embrace.
        </p>
        <p>
          But surely on the Rock, they stumble on Jesus, and they fall into
          Jezebel's embrace.
        </p>
        <p>
          But surely we cannot be condemned for good works? This is true! So
          where is the problem? Once again Jezebel uses the tactic of a
          half-truth: It is true that we are expected to do good works, that
          good works are pleasing to God, but they are not what makes you
          righteous before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>"...For with the heart one believes unto righteousness..." </b
          ><i>(You need humility to repent of your sins)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Jezebel has convinced many that by some reverent ritual, they can make
          themselves worthy before God. This is an impossible task to
          accomplish, and God knew that. We just have to humble ourselves enough
          to accept that He sent His only Son to open the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The end result is a veil of self-righteousness.
          <b>Religion exemplifies this process</b>. In Rev 2:23 Jesus is
          described as <b>"I am He Who searches the minds and hearts."</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words the Jezebel veil of perfection will not stand up
          against His piercing <b>"eyes of fire"</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >A fool will judge a man by his possessions, <br />
            Men can only judge men by their deeds, <br />
            But the apolocalyptic Jesus Christ judges men by the motives of
            their hearts.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Shame blocks many from openly accepting the gift of repentance. <br />
          They cannot stand before the mirror of their souls (The brazen laver
          in Moses' Tabernacle). (You have to look in the mirror and acknowledge
          who you are.) They build up their veil of lies, to deceive men, to
          deceive themselves, and perhaps eventually they might even believe
          they can deceive Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >They fail to accept Jesus' unconditional love, and cannot give or
            receive inconditional love. They start to worship what they trust
            in, the false image of their own self-righteousness.</b
          >
          Rev. 2:18 onwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Church the same applies. If a chruch becomes side tracked by
          ritual and <b>deeper things</b>, believing thay have made themselves
          more worthy before God, it has achieved nothing more than engaged in
          the idolatrous worship of its own self-righteous image.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a church becomes preoccupied with its ritual and traditions. When
          they begin to preach that this ritual and tradition is a prerequisite
          for the salvation of its people, then it has fallen into the clutches
          of Jezebel. Jezebel's final lie will always be the same.
        </p>

      <p>
        The logic is emotional, playing on feelings of guilt. The dogma ranges
        from a scatching condemnation, to a charming compromise, but it is
        always irrational when viewed against the Word. <br />
        Many futile hours can be wasted by a believer trying to bring light to
        these seductive teachings. You will always leave the presence of Jezebel
        feeling helpless, abuse, foolish and very often guilty. Unless you have
        agreed with them of course, then you will leave being convinced of that
        religion's God given ability to secure your salvation. <i>Paganism</i>

      <p>
        The end result is always the same, (1) a people with a sembleance of
        virtue, but with no power. (2) A people that are hard of heart, stubborn
        and divided. (3) A people who believe in their own strength, and merely
        use the name of Jesus to justify themselves. (4)A people who know of
        Jesus, but do not know Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        (5) A people who fail to grasp the concept of a covenant God, or that
        Abraham was the father of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        (6) A people that have not yet seen that they are peculiar and set
        apart, for although they preach a message of salvation by faith, and not
        works, they still trust in their own strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        (7) A People who still believe that the world should love them for their
        good and noble work.

        What happens to these people when the world rejects them for the name of
        Jesus???

      <h3>TAKING A LOOK AT JEZEBEL IN AN INDIVIDUAL</h3>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          The mind of Jezebel's prisoners are tormented<br />Tormented by the
          fear that the shame of their sin will be exposed when the veil of
          their perfection is torn. <br />They have a preoccuptation with what
          others say and think about them <br />They take offense easily, have
          touchy egos, and take any criticism extremely personally. <br />Their
          personalities are immmature, and by never having had the gumption to
          take responsiblity for their sin, they have no character or backbone
          <br />
          Their consciences are dulled and confused oftern to the point of
          psychopatic behavior. <br />
          They have no empathy for the sufferings of others, and are incapable
          of giving or receiving unconditional love. A prisoner of Jezebel is a
          spiritual cripple, and their spirit dies a slow and lingering death.
          <br />
          They are indecisive, and cannot make a definite decision, because they
          fear that their making the wrong decision will tarnish wheir veil of
          perfection. <br />By the same token, the prisoner will be obsessed
          with being the authority figure. A combination that leads to total
          destabilization and trust in the group. <br />They will drive their
          children to resentment and rebellion, or destroy their spirit into
          desperate submission. <br />
          They will get no loyalty from their employess, and their staff will
          always be on edge. <br />They are obsessed with authority and believe
          they are very gifted leaders. <br />
          They project their failings onto those around them especially teir
          loved ones. <br />They escape criticism by blaming a scapegoat and
          then reject it from their area of control by turning all under is
          authority against the scapegoat. <br />
          The prisoner of jezebel will always make use of the half-truth.
          <br />They are great believers of the manipulative power of money.
          <br />
          In business they shy away from written contracts and always try to get
          a person's commitment on a "never-never" basis. <br />They fear death
          and illness. <br />They have a fear of man because they think that all
          men think linke they do. <br />They are Religious. <br />They prayers
          are superficial, if not absent totally. <br />They do not understand
          Rigteousness before God. <br />
          They cannot accept the gift of repentance. <br />They cannot see the
          difference between humility before God and shame before men.
          <br />They have great problems with sexual lust, especially in their
          thoughts. <br />Their thoughts are devoted to hours of contemplating
          infinite ways of preserving their images of perfection. <br />They
          abhor Christian fellowship. <br />Their discussions around the Truth
          of Jesus Christ is superficial and they always cop-out by falling back
          on religious dogma and ritual.
