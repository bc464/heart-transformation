      PROCESS OF TRAINING FOR MINISTRY TEAMS & MONITORS FOR TOUCHING HEARTS
      MINISTRIES.
    </h3>
    <p>TOUCHING HEARTS COURSE: 11 DAY or 18 WEEKS</p>
    <p>8-DAY MINISTRY TRAINING</p>
    <p>MEMBER OF MINISTRY TEAM OR INTERCESSOR</p>
    <p>MINISTRY TEAM LEADER</p>
    <p>MONITORING</p>
    <p>Complete the Touching Hearts Course and then if you feel called of God to become part of the MInistry Team or an Intercessor, or Monitor, complete the 9-Day Ministry Training. Thereafter, as the next phase of the Training, become part of a Ministry Team  when the course is being run again. This provides the practical hands-on training as a Ministry Team member or Intercessor, as you get furhter trained by your Monitor or (Caroline if she is running the course) or a Team-leader. A team leader is one who has more experience and has been released by the Monitor to lead a team. If God were calling one to be a monitor, then, with your local church's blessing, you would then be interviewed by Touching Hearts Ministries before being released into monitoring.</p>
