        Heb 5:14 - But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have
        trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.

        1 Corinthians 12:8, 10 - Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it
        away from me. 10 That is why, for Christâ€™s sake, I delight in
        weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties.
        For when I am weak, then I am strong.
