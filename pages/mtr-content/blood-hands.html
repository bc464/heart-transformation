      <h3>FREE FROM THE BLOOD OF MEN</h3>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>Scripture Reading - Acts 20:26-35</p>
        <p>
          "Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the
          blood of all men."(Acts 20:26).
        </p>
        <p>
          Not many of My children can say that they are free from the blood of
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I said to Ezekiel that if he would not warn the wicked to flee from
          his wicked way, to save his life, the same wicked man would die in his
          iniquity, and I would require his blood at Ezekiel's hand. (Ezekiel
          3:18)
        </p>
        <p>
          The blood of generations of lost souls is upon My children. This
          generation of lost souls id the greatest of all time. Nations like
          Chine (ovr 1000 millions), India (700 millions), Bangladesh (90
          millions), the Philippines (50 millions), Indonesia (150 millions),
          Japan (118 millions), Malaysia (14 millions), Hong Kong (52 millions)
          are teeming with souls. Asia alone is the home of nearly tow thirds of
          the 4000 millions souls on this planet. I need missionaries. I need
          men like Paul and women like Priscilla who will do <b>My</b> work with
          a heart abandoned to Me and a great love for the lost. But ... alas, I
          have too few who care, who go, who pray, who give and sacrifice to
          send others. I want to send you as lights to the nations in the
          uttermost parts of the earth. But each man cares only for himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spoke to A.C.Jeffries, My missionary pioneer to Indonesia, in a
          dream, I showed him the millions of souls marching to hell. When he
          awakened he saw blood on his hands. He rededicated his life, even in
          old age, unto Me, and went to India where I used him in a mighty way.
          Age is no barrier for being used by Me for soul-winning. Tell the
          older people who have reached retirement to dedicate their lives unto
          Me and to go out and preach and teach and live for Me among the lost
          of this last generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My child, I can send you anywhere and I can open any door. There is
          nothing too hard for Me. Make no excuses. Fast and pray for a burden
          for souls. I need an army. I will use whoever is willing to offer up
          this life. My Holy Spirit will work through anyone, man or woman,
          adult or chold, without exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pray for Me to give you a love and a burden for the lost. Ask Me for a
          vision, for without a vision the people perish.(Proverbs 29:18). The
          angels are grieving for the multitudes who are going to hell. They
          weep for the lost. More are going to hell in this one year than in
          centuries of the past. Hell is enlarging its borders to make room for
          the millions of Asia alone. Put this burden on My people. Awaken them.
          I will work with you ... Sound the alarm.
        </p>
        <p><i>Lord, I tearfully ask:</i></p>
        <p>
          Teach me to pray with groanings<br />
          so that there are earthquakes in hell.<br />
          Teach me the groanings of the Spirit<br />
          until angels stand in awe. <br />
          Teach me Spirit-born intercession<br />
          that changes history.<br />
          Teach me the birth pangs of the Holy Ghost<br />
          until hell shaking revivial in born. <br />Lead me into travail that
          holds back divine judgment<br />
          from the nations for a little season.<br />
          Let me be a living sacrifice on the altar of prayer<br />
          "bleeding to bless"<br />
          until flood tides of mercy sweep the nations. <br />
          Lord, break my heart in intercession until my eyes,<br />
          like those of Jeremiah, are a fountain of tears,<br />
          weeping for the slain of an educated, <br />
          but spiritual dead people.
