      <h3>3 LEVELS OF DEMONIC OPERATIONS:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heavenlies and galaxies</li>
        <li>
          On Earth (mountains and the hills).
          <p>
            Ezekiel prophesied to them and this proves that there are demonic
            powerbases on the mountains. Elijah had to win the battle on Mount
            Carmel.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>In the Waters.</li>
        <li>
          Leviathan. Crocodile, Neptune, Queen of the sea, Poseidon, Sea serpent
          / dragon, mermaids and mermen, nymphs (water fairies), Atlantis,
          dolphins, sirens
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Revelation teaches us about activities in the heavenlies and activities
        in the waters. Jezebel is a water spirit. She was a daughter og a priest
        of Ashtoreth (Astarte) - a water spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The image of Ashtoreth - the top is a human body and the bottom a fish.
        <br />
        Mermaid - this is the spirit that also killed Samson. The five Lords of
        the Philistines worshipped Dagon - half fish - half man.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must get knowledge concerning these spirits - there are certain ways
        in which they attack persons, families, cities, etc.

      <h3>GOD HAS DESIGNED A WAY TO DO WARFARE AGAINST THESE SPIRITS.</h3>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Ex 2:5 - Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and
          her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket
          among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it.
        </p>
        <p>The daughter of Pharoah takes a bath in the River Nile.</p>
        <p>
          Ex 7:15 - Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river.
          Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff
          that was changed into a snake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pharoah will be at the river early in the morning. You don't visit the
          king in his bathroom! Pharaoh was doing more than bathing at the river
          Nile!
        </p>
        <p>
          Ex 8:20 - Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning
          and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is
          what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
        </p>
        <p>Pharaoh was worshipping water spirits.</p>
        <p>NB!</p>
        <p>
          Ezek 29:2-3 - “Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt
          and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. Speak to him and say:
          ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘I am against you, Pharaoh
          king of Egypt, you great monster lying among your streams. You say,
          “The Nile belongs to me; I made it for myself.”
        </p>
        <p>Prophetic action against Pharaoh.</p>
        <p>Many kings and rules are controlled by water spirits.</p>
        <p>
          In Daniel 7 the beast that comes up out of the waters speaks of four
          kingdoms: Babylon, Persia, Rome, Greece - they were all controlled by
          water spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ex 7:17 - This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am
          the LORD: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of
          the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.
        </p>
        <p>Dealing with water spirits.</p>
        <p>
          Every plague that came against Egypt was God's way of dealing with
          their gods (various stages of demonic powers) - they had to be dealt
          with first becuase they controlled the Israelites. Once they were
          conquered, the people were set free and left Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rev 13:1 - The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast
          coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten
          crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beast comes up out of the sea. The water spirits controls the 666
          and they will be released to give out this number in the last days.
        </p>

      <div class="content-container_box">
        <h4>Daniel</h4>
        <p>Daniel had to win his battle by defeating water spirits.</p>
        <p>He prayed in the palace of the king three times per day.</p>
        <p>
          He prayed in the head office of the government three times per day -
          nothing happened. He prayed in the lion's den the whole night.
        </p>
        <p>He cried to God: <i>"Lord, I want to know."</i></p>
        <p>
          Then he went to the river Tigris (Dan 10:4) and realized that the
          matter had to be settled there.
        </p>
        <p>(Chapter 8)</p>
        <p>He started praying.</p>
        <p>He hit where it mattered.</p>
        <p>
          Then there was a breakthrough - Gabriel brought the message with the
          help of Michael.
        </p>
        <p>DID YOU KNOW THAT 75% OF YOUR BODY IS MADE UP OF WATER...</p>

        <h4>More examples of water spirits:</h4>
        <p>Mark 4:35-41</p>
        <p>(Num 30 -31)</p>
        <p>
          The country of the Gadarenes - was indwelt by the tribe of Reuben and
          half the tribe of Manassah who refused to cross over into Canaan. As
          Jesus crossed over a furious storm arose. Water spirits were trying to
          overturn the boat! There is no natural tree, rock, waters, etc. which
          on its own accord will challenge the authority of Jesus. In their
          natural accord the Bible says they give glory to God.
        </p>
        <p>Mark 5:1-13 -</p>
        <p>
          The pigs ran into the sea. In the natural hate water. So it was water
          spirits that chased them into the sea and the pigs died.
        </p>
        <p>2 Kings 2:19-22 -</p>
        <p>
          This was a demonic problem and Elisha had to break the curse and
          prohecy to the waters. There are waters that have been bewitched
          around our cities, which cause lot of barrenness in our people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many cities are built on rivers! The people who design the cities know
          all about gateways / bases of water spirits.

          </li>
          <li>
            Sacrificing to the water spirits - may cause that many never marry
            or are barren forever.

        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>NB SPIRITUAL WARFARE IS ACTION</h3>
      <p>
        We must become like a Daniel - he went to the valleys. Elijah and Elisha
        went up the mountains and down the rivers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 'things we have to do.' The major weapons of warfare are
        prophetic.

            Ivory Coast - they throw newborn babies into the sea. Three days
            later they return. If the baby is alive it is a gift from the gods
            of the sea filled with water spirits for a special destiny. If the
            baby dies it is a sacrifice to appease the gods.

            Lesotho - newborn baby is taken into the rain for "cleansing".
          </li>
