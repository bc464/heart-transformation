      <h3>THE MARRIAGE COVENANT</h3>
      <p>
        "The secret of a happy marriage is understanding and living out the
        covenant relationship. God judges Israel in Malachi 2:13-17 when they
        were covering the altar with their tears. He took no heed of their
        offering because they were not faithful in their marraiges."
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          God said to us in Psalm 25:14 "The secret (of the sweet, satisfying
          companionship) of the Lord have they who fear (revere and worship) Him
          will show His covenant and reveal to them its (deep inner) meaning."
          The importance of the covenant relationship between husband and wife
          and the way it parallels the rlationship between Christ and the Church
          is clearly stated in Eph 5:32 "This mystery is very great but I speak
          concerning the relation of Christ and the church."

      <h4>Let's take a brief look at what a CHristian Marriage Covenant is.</h4>
      <p>
        <i>(Extracts taken from Derek Prince's book</i> THE MARRIAGE COVENANT
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Eccl. 4:9-12 "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward
          for their labour for if they labour for if they fall, the one will
          lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has
          not another to lift him up! Again as two lie down together, they have
          warmth; but how can one be warm alone? And though a man might prevail
          against him who is alone, two will withstand him. A threefold cord is
          not quickly broken."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is not good for man to be alone." The first part referes to 2
          people on the human plane - the second a man, a woman and God, the
          principle that binds them together is the covenant. It has been known
          that the strongest rope has 3 cords. The largest number of strands
          that can all touch one another is three, so it cannot easily be
          broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Genesis 15:7-18. God initiates the covenant with Abraham. The way a
          covenant was made in the Old Testament was: "the animal that was
          killed, was cut into 2 parts, the parts were placed opposite one
          another with a space in between. Then the people who were making the
          covenant passed between the 2 parts of the sacrifice." (in a figure
          eight)
        </p>
        <p>
          The sacrifice symbolized the death of each party to the covenant. As
          each party walked through between the pieces of slain animal, he was
          saying, 'That is my death. That animal died as my representative - He
          dies in my place."
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb. 9:7-17 states that a death has to take place before a testament
          or will can come into operation - the same applies to a covenant. As
          each party passes through the piece of the sacrifice, he says in
          effect - "if need be, I will die for you. From now on your interests
          take precedence over my own. If I have anything you need but cannot
          supply, then my supply becomes your supply. I no longer live for
          myself. I live for you."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"The sacrifice upon which the covenant of the Christian marriage is
            based, is the death of Jesus Christ on our behalf. The covenant of a
            Christian marriage is made at the foot of the Cross. "</i
          >
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>There are 3 phases to the covenant.</h3>

      <div class="content-container_box">
        <h3>PHASE 1- LAYING DOWN YOUR LIFE:</h3>
        <p>
          "The husband looks back at CHrist's death on the cross and says:
          <i
            >'That death was my death. When I came through the cross I died. Now
            I am no longer living for myself.'</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "Each hold nothing back from the other. Everything the husband has is
          for the wife. Everything the wife has is for the husband. No
          reservations, nothing held back."
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <h3>PHASE 2 - "OUT OF THE DEATH COMES NEW LIFE"</h3>
        <p>
          "Each now lives out that new life in and through the other. The
          husband says to his wife "My life is in you. I am living out my life
          through you. You are the expression of what I am" - likewise the
          wife."
        </p>
        <p>
          Often when counselling, I look at a woman and can see what kind of
          husband she has, whether he loves her or not. She would reflect his
          glory - just as the moon reflects the light of the sun. No wonder the
          Scripture speaks of in 1 Cor 11:7 "he is the image and (reflected)
          glory of God (his function of government reflects the majesty of the
          divine Rule); but woman is (the expression of) man's glory (majesty,
          pre-eminence)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also true that they would reflect each other's problem. When the
          woman has all kinds of hang-ups and is insecure, it is likely that the
          husband is not being her covering by truly loving and protecting her
          physically and spiritually as Christ loved the Church. Song of Solomon
          2:4 "He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was
          love (for love waved as a protecting and comforting banner over my
          head when I was near him)"
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <h3>PHASE 3:</h3>
        <p>
          "The covenant is brought to completion by physical union,and this in
          turn brings forth fruit, which continues the new life that each has
          been willing to share with the other. Without union there can be no
          fruit. Covenant leads to shared life and fruitfulness. Life that is
          not shared is sterile and fruitless.
        </p>
        <p>
          That also reminds me of the scripture in John 15:4 "Remain in me, as I
          also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain
          in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Marriage is not, "Gimme, gimme." Somebody has once said that if one
          goes into marriage with a 50% - 50% give and take - that you will be
          heading for the divorce courts. It must be 100% - 100% give and take.
          We should not think 'what is there in this for me' but rather (How
          can) "I give my life - I lay it down for you and then I find my new
          life in you." This holds for both husband and wife. It is true that in
          marriage we learn the art of forgiveness!(70 X7). So oftern people
          come for counselling and they say "What must I do? I do not love my
          partner anymore." The inevitable answer is that love is not feeling,
          it is a decision, a willingness to choose to forgive in the Name of
          Jesus, then the feelings will fall in line.

      <h3>THE FIVE DIFFERENT LOVES</h3>
      <p><i>("Love Life for Every Married Couple" - Ed Whaet)</i></p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          "The Greeks of New Testament era had 5 words to describe various
          aspects of love in marriage."
        </p>
        <p>
          Each builds on the other and they are all needed for a rich and
          fulfilling marriage.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>EPITHUMIA</b> - "a strong desire of any kind - good or bad. To
            set heart on, long for, rightfully or otherwise, or to covet. In a
            negative way, it can be lust. In a positive way - desire. Affects
            the sexual side of the marriage."
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>EROS</b> - "is romantic, passionate and sentimental, rature,
            exquisite pleasure, strong sweet and terrifying because it is
            all-absorbing." It is emotional, not caused by the will,but will be
            the result or outcome when putting into practice the other loves of
            marriage. It will make one's marriage a true delight and it is part
            of God's plan for a fulfilled marriage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>STORGE</b>- "a comfortable old-shoe relationship comprised of
            natural affection and a sense of belonging to each other." It is a
            sense of belonging, where people care and give the utmost loyalty to
            each other. It offers security where the other loves of marriages
            can grow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PHILEO</b> - "Cherishes and has tender affection for the beloved,
            but always expects a repsonse. It is a love of relationship,
            comradeship, sharing, communication, friendship. Share thoughts,
            feelings, attitudes, plans and dreams - things they wouldn't share
            with others. Also time and interest." Even if one in marriage loves
            in a phileo way, the other is sure to respond - it makes marriage
            interesting and fulfilling.
          </li>
          <li>
            The best is <b>AGAPE</b> - "totally unselfish, give without
            expecting anything in return - values and serves - choice of your
            will and has no dependence on feelings - action not emotion." With
            Agape love, a marriage can survive anything. Yu are commande by
            Scripture to have a love affair with your marriage partner.

          Prov. 5:18-19 "Let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife
          of thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant doe, let her
          breasts satisfy thee at all times, and be thou ravished always with
          her love." Amplified - "Let your fountain (of human life) be blessed
          (with the rewards of fidelity) and rejoice in the wife of your youth.
          Let her bosom satisfy you at all times, and always be transported with
          delight in her love." KJV - "be thou ravished always with her love."
          "Ravished" in Hebrew means "to reel and stagger as if intoxicated, to
          be enraptured and exhilarated." To be "satisfied" is to have your
          thirst slaked, to take your fill, to be saiated and abundantly
          saturated with that which pleases. "Be thou ravished always with her
          love" is ahavah, which includes emotional love in response to
          attraction. It is the Hebrew counterpart of N.T. agape love - the love
          or the spirit and will, committed to do best for beloved at all times.
          As we give so we will receive. In the same way Christ loves His bride
          - the church.

              hold hands, held, and kissed outside of the bedroom, during the
              day, in love and tenderness (non sexual physical contact - helps
              to nurture one another).

        <h4>God hates divorce? Not always.</h4>
        <p>
          "In Malachi 2:16, many Bibles have the words, "I hate divorce, says
          the Lord God of Israel.". These words have been paraphrased and turned
          into the well known saying "God hates divorce."
        </p>
        <p>This saying is really problematic for victims of domestic abuse.</p>
