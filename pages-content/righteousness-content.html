      <h1>Righteousness vs Self-Righteousness</h1>
      <h2>Ephesians 2:8-9</h2>
      <p>
        Eph 2:8  for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of
        yourselves; it is the gift of God, Eph 2:9  not of works, that no one
        would boast.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>OUR GOD IS A GOD OF RELATIONSHIP</h3>
      <div class="content-box">
        <p>
          Isa 61:1  The Lord Yahweh’s Spirit is on me; because Yahweh has
          anointed me to preach good news to the humble. He has sent me to bind
          up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
          release to those who are bound; Isa 61:2  to proclaim the year of
          Yahweh’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all
          who mourn; Isa 61:3  to provide for those who mourn in Zion, to give
          to them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment
          of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees
          of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh, that he may be glorified. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Luk 24:11  These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t
          believe them. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph 4:11  He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
          evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers; Eph 4:12  for the
          perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up
          of the body of Christ; Eph 4:13  until we all attain to the unity of
          the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown
          man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; Eph
          4:14  that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and
          carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in
          craftiness, after the wiles of error; Eph 4:15  but speaking truth in
          love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head,
          Christ; Eph 4:16  from whom all the body, being fitted and knit
          together through that which every joint supplies, according to the
          working in measure of each individual part, makes the body increase to
          the building up of itself in love. Eph 4:17  This I say therefore, and
          testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the
          Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,

        God is wanting to restore His bride and prepare her for His coming. He
        is coming for a bride that is without spot or blemish. He will not be
        unequally yoked with His bride.

      <h3>SOME SCRIPTURES ON GOD'S BLUEPRINT FOR A BLESSED LIFE</h3>
      <div class="content-box">
        <p>
          Proverbs 3:5-6 Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on
          your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will
          make your paths straight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proverbs 9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and
          knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proverb 24:3-4 By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding
          it is established; through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare
          and beautiful treasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proverbs 31:11-12, 26-30 Her husband has full confidence in her and
          lacks nothing of value. She brings him good, not harm, all the days of
          her life. She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her
          tongue. She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat
          the bread of idleness. Her children arise and call her blessed; her
          husband also, and he praises her: “Many women do noble things, but you
          surpass them all.” Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a
          woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 133:1 How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together
          in unity!
        </p>
        <p>
          Is. 32:17-18 The fruit of that righteousness will be peace; its effect
          will be quietness and confidence forever. My people will live in
          peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of
          rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gal. 6:9-10 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper
          time we will reap a harvest if we do no give up. Therefore, as we have
          opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who
          belong to the family of believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph. 4:26-29, 32 In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down
          while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.
          Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work,
          doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have
          something to share with those in need. Do not let any unwholesome talk
          come out of your month, but only what is helpful for building others
          up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. Be
          kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as
          in Christ God forgave you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Titus 2:5 to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be
          kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign
          the word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Cor. 14:1, 33 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the
          Spirit, especially prohecy. For God is not a God of disorder but of
          peace - as in all the congregations of the Lord's people.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Cor. 11:3 But I want you to realize that the head of every man is
          Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph 6:1-4 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
          “Honor your father and mother”—which is the first commandment with a
          promise— “so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long
          life on the earth.” Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead,
          bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph 5:2 and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave
          himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Col 3:12-16 Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved,
          clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and
          patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you
          has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And
          over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in
          perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as
          members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Let the
          message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one
          another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the
          Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 139: 23-24 Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my
          anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me
          in the way everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 28:26 Those who trust in themselves are fools, but those who
          walk in wisdom are kept safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Pet. 1:5-9 For this very reason, make every effort to add to your
          faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge,
          self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance,
          godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual
          affection, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing
          measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in
          your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But whoever does not have
          them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed
          from their past sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Cor 13:4-8 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does
          not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not
          self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
          Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always
          protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never
          fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there
          are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will
          pass away.

          Matt. 23:27-28 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you
          hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on
          the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and
          everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to
          people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and
          wickedness.

          prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers,
          evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a
          week and give a tenth of all I get.’ “But the tax collector stood at a
          distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and
          said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ “I tell you that this man,
          rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those
          who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves
          will be exalted.”

          Eph 2:8-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith —and

          1 Cor 4:5 Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait

          will receive their praise from God.

          John 8:4-11, 15 and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in
          the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such
          women. Now what do you say?” They were using this question as a trap,
          in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and
          started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on
          questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of
          you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” Again he
          stooped down and wrote on the ground. At this, those who heard began
          to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was
          left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and
          asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” “No one,
          sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go
          now and leave your life of sin.” You judge by human standards; I pass
          judgment on no one.

        <p>
          I believe our thoughts sound as loudly in heaven as our words do on
          earth. All sin starts in the mind; therefore we are only as holy as
          our "thought lives" are holy.

          The fear of the Lord is the answer to all problems connected with
          relationships. In order for us to understand what God intends us to
          experience in relationships here on earth, we first have to look at
          the model He has given us. We find it in John 17:11 where Jesus prays
          to the Father for the ultimate: "That they (all believers) may be one,
          even as (the Trinity) are one." That means that within the limitations
          of our humanity, we can experience through the power of the Holy
          Spirit, the same quality of love that exists among the Father, Son and
          Holy Spirit.

        <p>
          I will never forget when that amazing truth hit me, and I really
          believed it for the first time. A number of years ago, I was in a room
          in Denmark praying with three married couples - all missionaries. God
          had broken through by His Spirit and brought real brokenness and
          openness among them. I was experiencing such an outpouring of the love
          of God toward them, that I asked the Holy Spirit to give me the
          greatest possible prayer I could pray for each couple. Then I waited
          in expectancy for the answer.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          It didn't come quickly. God was testing me as to how long I would wait
          to get the maximum request. I remember responding while I continued to
          wait: "I love them Lord. They're worth waiting for." After some time,
          the Holy Spirit brought to my mind with great clarity Jesus'
          prayer:"That they may be one, even as we are one."
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          As I prayed in faith for the greatest blessing-prayer that could be
          released from headquarters heaven for human relationships on planet
          earth, there was an explosion of revelation and excitement in my
          spirit that day that has never left me. For I then realized that this
          was God's norm for all our relationships as Christians - regardless of
          whether the combination includes old or young, single or married, male
          or female. After all, the quality of love emanating from the Godhead
          is the same to everyone, and I believe it is expressed in the same
          way. So why should it be any different when it flows through us to
          anyone else?

      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          I cannot imagine Jesus His love any diffently to Mary and Martha than
          to Lazarus. Nor can I think for a moment He would experience any
          awkardness in any area of His relationships with them, - collectively
          or separately. Not even when He was alone with lovely, marriagable,
          deeply spiritual, devoted Mary as she sat at His feet, listening to
          His teaching. I don't expect she was looking out the window either.
          She would be looking into His eyes, drinking in every word, as she did
          on another occasion when Jesus was in Bethany with His disciples:
          "Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the
          feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was

          The scenes are imtimate, without any sexual connotation! There is no
          embarrassment, or sin, because there is no guilt - in either party.
        </p>
        <p>Let us switch scenes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">

          Jesus is now in the house of the Pharisee having a meal, and an
          ex-prostitute hears He's there(Luke 7:36-50). She seizes the
          opportunity of getting close to Him, away from the enevitable crowd
          that always followed Him. She gate-crashes the party and immediately
          proceeds to open up her alabaster flesk of ointment.Then she
          demonstratively bursts into tears, which splash over His feet.
          Undaunted by the cold, critical stares of the Pharisees host, she uses
          her long hair to mop up the tear stains, and unashamedly kisses His
          feet and then anoints them with the ointment.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          She lavishly express devotion and gratitude of her heart to the One
          who has ever shown her such love, such forgiveness, such recognition,
          such respect, and who has given her such peace of mind. Does all the
          display of affection faze Jesus? Is He embarrassed? He's totally
          relaxed. With calm authority, He rebukes the religious host and
          praises the repentant woman from the streets. Again the scene is
          intimate, without sexual connotation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">

          None of this should really suprise us when we understand that one of
          the purposes of Jesus Christ's leaving heaven and coming to this earth
          was to show us how to live. For that rewason, we can see He was
          demonstrating through the relationships with those two women that true
          holiness and naturalness go hand in hand.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          In fact, only really holy people are free to be really natural. They
          have nothing to hide, there is no need to act. There is nothing to
          cover up.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">

          With the fear of the Lord upon us, we're able to experience the kind
          of love that Peter talks about in 1 Peter 1:22 and express it to
          anyone at any time: "Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying
          the truth so that you have sincere love for your brother, love one
          another deeply, from the heart."
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Throughout God's Word, we find love and holiness are frequently linked
          together. Holiness is thought, word and deed releases us to be loving
          and tender in our relationships without a particle of lust. In 1
          Thessalonians 3:12-23 we read: "And may the Lord make you increase and
          abound in love to one another and to all men, as we do to you, so that
          He may extablish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and
          Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints." Also in
          Philippians 1:9-10 we find: "And it is my prayer that your love may
          abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you
          may approve what is excellent, and may be pure and blameless for the
          day of Christ.""
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          These verses make it clear that we are not to be afraid of the depth
          of love toward one another provided every relationship can stand the
          test of the bright, white light of the Holy Spirit's standard of
          purity in thought, word and deed.

          God the Father entrusted His Son with the close friendships of women
          such as Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene, as well as Peter, James
          and John. Hebrew 4:15 says: "He was in all points tempted like as we
          are, yet without sin." According to this verse, He has suffer
          temptation, which could include the area of friendship, in order to
          become our understanding High Priest and intercessor.

          My understanding of human relationships deepened when I saw that only
          God can totally fulfil any human being, therefore, no human being will
          ever toally fulfil me - or you. When God leads an man or a woman
          together in a marraige relationship, provided they live together
          according to His ways, those two people will complement each other,
          meet needs in each other, and be to each other in numerous ways what
          no one else will ever be to each other. In other words, it is a unique
          relationship of a type that can be experienced only by total joining
          together and commitment of marriage.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          However, marraige was never intended by God to be an all-inclusive
          thing in regard to human relationships; otherwise, there would be no
          justice to the single person.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          There would also be no room for a Jesus and Mary relationship(both
          Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene); or a Jesus and John, or a David
          and Jonathan. These were all very close relationships outside
          marriage.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">

          God delights to give in-depth friendships to His children, in
          proportion to the fear of God operating in their lives, regardless of
          their sex. So, we cannot expect every area of our lives, even in
          relation to friendship fulfilment, to be found in mariage alone.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Now, let's look more closely at God the Father, God the Son, and God
          the Holy Spirit. The more we understand the nature of this
          relationship and the principles by which they operate, the more we can
          cooperate with the Lord Jesus in the fulfilment of His prayer for
          Trinity unity(John 17:11) among His present disciples.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Let us measure our relationships - any and all of them - alongside
          God's standard for us, which is the relationship of the Trinity.
