        "Little children, keep yourselves from idols (false gods) - [from
        anything and everything that would occupy the place in your heart due to
        God, from any sort of substitute for Him that would take first place in
        your life]. Amen (so let it be).' 1 JOhn 5:21

      <div class="conent-container_box">
        <p>1 John 5:21 - Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.</p>
        <p>
          Deut 5:6-10 - “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt,
          out of the land of slavery. “You shall have no other gods before me.
          “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in
          heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall
          not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a
          jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the
          third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to
          a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deut 8:7-20 - For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land
          —a land with brooks, streams, and deep springs gushing out into the
          valleys and hills; a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees,
          pomegranates, olive oil and honey; a land where bread will not be
          scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and
          you can dig copper out of the hills. When you have eaten and are
          satisfied, praise the LORD your God for the good land he has given
          you. Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God, failing to
          observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you
          this day. Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build
          fine houses and settle down, and when your herds and flocks grow large
          and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied, then
          your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God,
          who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. He led you
          through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless
          land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out
          of hard rock. He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something
          your ancestors had never known, to humble and test you so that in the
          end it might go well with you. You may say to yourself, “My power and
          the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.” But
          remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to
          produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your
          ancestors, as it is today. If you ever forget the LORD your God and
          follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against
          you today that you will surely be destroyed. Like the nations the LORD
          destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the
          LORD your God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt 6:24 - “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the
          one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise
          the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Cor 10:22 - Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we
          stronger than he?
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Sam 15:22-23 - But Samuel replied: “Does the LORD delight in burnt
          offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the LORD? To obey is
          better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. For
          rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil
          of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has
          rejected you as king.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Jer 3:14 - “Return, faithless people,” declares the LORD, “for I am
          your husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a
          clan—and bring you to Zion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph 4:17-24 - So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that
          you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their
          thinking. They are darkened in their understanding and separated from
          the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the
          hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity, they have
          given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of
          impurity, and they are full of greed. That, however, is not the way of
          life you learned when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in
          accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught, with
          regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is
          being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the
          attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like
          God in true righteousness and holiness. 5.5 For of this you can be
          sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater
          —has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Romans 1:18-20 - The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven
          against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the
          truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain
          to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation
          of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine
          nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been
          made, so that people are without excuse. 25 They exchanged the truth
          about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather
          than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zech 7:11-12 - “But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they
          turned their backs and covered their ears. They made their hearts as
          hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the
          LORD Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So
          the LORD Almighty was very angry.
        </p>
        <p>Phil 4:13 - I can do all this through him who gives me strength.</p>
        <p>
          2 Peter 1:3 - His divine power has given us everything we need for a
          godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory
          and goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Col 2:3 - in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and
          knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph 3:16-19 - I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen
          you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ
          may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being
          rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the
          Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is
          the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge
          —that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb 8:10 - This is the covenant I will establish with the people of
          Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their
          minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they
          will be my people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joshua 1:8-9 - Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate
          on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything
          written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. Have I not
          commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be
          discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.”
        </p>
        <p>
          James 4:1-10 - What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they
          come from your desires that battle within you? You desire but do not
          have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you
          quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. When
          you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that
          you may spend what you get on your pleasures. You adulterous people,
          don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against
          God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes
          an enemy of God. Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he
          jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us? But he
          gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the
          proud but shows favor to the humble.” Submit yourselves, then, to God.
          Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come near to God and he
          will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your
          hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your
          laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before
          the Lord, and he will lift you up.

          Acts 4:12 - Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other

        <p>
          1 Tim 2:25-29 - For there is one God and one mediator between God and
          mankind, the man Christ Jesus,

        <p>
          Jer 2:25-29 - Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is
          dry. But you said, ‘It’s no use! I love foreign gods, and I must go
          after them.’ “As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the people
          of Israel are disgraced— they, their kings and their officials, their
          priests and their prophets. They say to wood, ‘You are my father,’ and
          to stone, ‘You gave me birth.’ They have turned their backs to me and
          not their faces; yet when they are in trouble, they say, ‘Come and
          save us!’ Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them
          come if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you, Judah,
          have as many gods as you have towns. “Why do you bring charges against
          me? You have all rebelled against me,” declares the LORD.

          Matt 19:29 - And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters
          or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will
          receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. 10:37 -
        </p>
        <p>
          “Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of
          me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy
          of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke 14:26 - If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and
          mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own
          life—such a person cannot be my disciple.
