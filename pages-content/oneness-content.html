        that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe and be

        which You have given Me, that they may be one[even] as We are one.

          Ps. 113:5-6 Who is like the LORD our God, the One who sits enthroned
          on high, who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 138:6 Though the LORD is exalted, he looks kindly on the lowly;
          though lofty, he sees them from afar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is. 57:15 For this is what the high and exalted One says— he who lives
          forever, whose name is holy: “I live in a high and holy place, but
          also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the
          spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.

        <p>
          Phil. 2:5-11 In your relationships with one another, have the same
          mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not
          consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
          rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a
          servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance
          as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death — even
          death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and
          gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus
          every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and
          every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
          God the

          Col. 2:18-23 Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the
          worship of angels disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great
          detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions
          by their unspiritual mind. They have lost connection with the head,
          from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments
          and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. Since you died with Christ
          to the elemental spiritual forces of this world, why, as though you
          still belonged to the world, do you submit to its rules: “Do not
          handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”? These rules, which have to do
          with things that are all destined to perish with use, are based on
          merely human commands and teachings. Such regulations indeed have an
          appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false
          humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any
          value in restraining sensual indulgence.

        <p>
          Ps 25:9 He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his
          way.

        <p>
          Is 29:19 Once more the humble will rejoice in the LORD; the needy will
          rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

          Prov. 15:33 Wisdom’s instruction is to fear the LORD, and humility
          comes before honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 10:17 You, LORD, hear the desire of the afflicted; you encourage
          them, and you listen to their cry,
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 11:2 When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility
          comes wisdom.

          Matt 20:25-28 Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the
          rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials
          exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants
          to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to
          be first must be your slave— just as the Son of Man did not come to be
          served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

          Col. 3:12-17 Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved,
          clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and
          patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you
          has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And
          over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in
          perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as
          members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Let the
          message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one
          another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the
          Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And whatever you
          do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus,

          Oneness - Purity-Unity is the call of the last day Church and cry of
          the Body of Christ. If the Spirit does not draw you, Oneness will not
          work. Only the Glory can make us ONE - only His Spirit can make us
          ONE. We see political power through numbers of so-called
          organizations, to have a so-called mouthpiece or platform, to change a
          nation. Others use it to further their church political careers
          without heaven authority. Zechariah says it this way, 'NOT BY MIGHT,
          NOR BY POWER, BUT BY MY SPIRIT(of whom the oil is a symbol) SAITH THE
          LORD OF HOSTS (Jehovah of armies 1 Sam 1:3)". Our battle is not with
          flesh ot through flesh, but our victory and power are through the
          Resurrection of the Living Christ. Elisha prayed for his servant
          Gehazi in 2 Kings 6:14-20, as the Syrians army surrounded them to kill
          Elisha - LORD OPEN HIS EYES THAT HE MAY SEE. And he saw the mountain
          full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. In these last
          days I believe we need to see and know what is happening in the Glory
          realm to have vision and revelation to the plan, purpose and pursuit
          of God to fulfil everything God has for us. Refuse to settle for less.
          When you get to heaven and Jesus says; "This is what you could have
          had, but you settled for less." Ephesians 4:3 Endeavouring to keep the
          unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.(King James Version). Being
          diligent to keep the ONENESS of the Spirit in the uniting bond of
          peace. (Recovery Version)

          Only when we are one with the Lord, and the Lord is one with us, can
          we begin to strive for oneness.
          <i>You abide in Me, and My Word abides in you</i>- a coming together.
          You draw near He draws near. Then we can keep the oneness of the
          Spirit as we are in Fellowship and Communion with HIM > Unity is
          formed by many people coming together, but oneness is the entity of
          the Spirit within the believers making them one. Oneness is greater
          than unity, it is not union or a united front - ONENESS IS A PERSON,
          even the LORD JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF realized as the life-giving Spirit
          within us, AND THE SPIRIT IS OUR ONENESS

          Oneness - electricity - lights - shine. When you have many lights in a
          room you have one current of electricity flowing through the lights to
          make it shine. The lights are not one; not united to form one entity.
          Electricity in the lights is Oneness. Believers in Christ - Eph 4:3
          must be diligent to maintain the oneness of the Spirit, so that we can
          be united in peace and be bonded together for the purpose of one body,
          one Spirit, one hope and One God and Father, so that Grace can flow
          from us and that we can come to the full measure of the statute of
          Christ, through the 5 fold ministry. That we be perfected doing work
          of the ministry unto edifying of the body of the Christ, that we are
          not tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine and be deceived.

          God wants the bones of Ezekiel to come together, come as one, so that
          the army of the Lord will rise up in power and might through the
          Spirit, and take our rightful victory and inheritance and march with
          REVIVAL through the land. The oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit
          Himself. You cannot have oneness of the Spirit apart from the Spirit.
          When you keep the oneness, you keep life and by that you give of the
          Spirit to have oneness. Many are talking about unity and oneness but
          neglect the Spirit. The more you talk about unity the more you become
          divided.

          Oneness is like a dove when you make a noise it flies away. Oneness
          should be natural not cosmetic. We exist together by Christ as the
          holding centre, just as the spokes of a wheel hold together by the hub
          at their centre. We are glued together. When husband and wife are
          together you see oneness, but when they are not together you still see
          them together. When you see the wife you also see the husband and vice
          versa. When you see the Spirit you see Oneness and when you see
          Oneness you see the Spirit. You cannot keep oneness by mere talking
          about it; you keep it by staying in the life-giving Spirit, by staying
          in the Love of the LOrd and embracing HIM IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST THE
          ANOINTING THE ANOINTED ONE. To live "apart" from the Spirit - any
          decision taken "apart" from the Spirit is divisive. One with the
          Spirit living according to Him and doing all things in Him, we keep
          the oneness without any conscious effert to do so. Take care of the
          life-giving Spirit who is the Lord Himslef. Keeping the oneness of the
          Spirit requires transformation into His Image and Likeness. If you are
          not transformed, you will not have the lowliness or the meekness
          necessay to keep the oneness. The more we are transformed the more
          spontaneously we inherit lowliness, meekness, and longsuffering.
          Problem with oneness comes when we are carnal minded, and there is too
          much of ourselves in ourselves wanting to return to Egypt and the
          comfort of the flesh. Many have a form of godliness but deny the power
          of the Spirit. Baby or childish Christians cannot keep the oneness of
          Spirit. It is process of growth and maturity. The same with a
          marraige, it grows into perfectness. For us to have the oneness of the
          Spirit we need to be transformed from one degree of glory to the next
          change of heart.

          Let us look for a moment at the Glory that makes us ONE with the
          Father and the Son - JOhn 17:22. The Glory that the Father gave to His
          Son is revealed into the Father's life and divine nature that
          expresses the Father in His fullness. This Glory that the Son gives
          corporate expression of God. The believers having their self fully
          denied, enjoy the Glory of the Father. Jesus can only be fully
          expressed through us once we experience His Glorification and
          Resurrection in our oneness with Him and others. We participate in
          this oneness through eternal life, the Word and the divine glory.
          Glory is the expression of God through His splendour. When the Glory
          of God envelopes His people and comes in a form of a cloud or mist or
          smoke, the people become one with the cloud, then eventually you do
          not see the people but only the cloud of His presence.

          1 Cor. 10:2 - And was all baptized UNTO Moses in the cloud; 2 Cor
          5:11-14 says that the priests, singers, trumpeters were one; Then the
          house was filled with a cloud that the priests could not stand to
          minister. Christ has abolished on the cross all the differences, in
          doing so He has made peace for His Body. We must also realize that the
          differences between us have been removed. This peace that binds is
          together is the uniting bond, the actual working of the cross. When we
          become crossed out, His peace begins to work. The Kingdom of God is
          Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the HOLY GHOST - IN THE GLORY. On the
          day of Pentecost when the Spirit was poured out as Joel prophesied, it
          began a work of righteousness that brought us peace. The effect of
          that has given us quietness and assurance in the Body of Christ for
          one another. Where there is confusion, misunderstanding, envying,
          strife and every evil work, you know that the wisdom of this earth is
          working through earthly, natural and demonic activity. Self-willed and
          hypocrite believers and church leaders who are motivated by an impure
          heart, yield salt water and corrupt conversation with an unclean
          conscience. It is the Glory that makes us One not because we are
          Pentacostal or Charismatic or have the same thinking, it is because we
          have the same Heart that seeks and hungers and thirst after God in a
          time such as this - REVIVAL. Your own plan and agenda will not work in
          a Spirit of Oneness - Selfishness, Pride, Arrogance, My Will be done.

          <i
            >"Here come these men you can see they have been with Jesus; they
            have come to turn the world upside down."</i
          >
          You as a Pastor, Christian and believer should walk in the newness of
          life through the fellowship of the Spirit so that eternal life can be
          manifested to you. 1 John 1:1-2:11 talks about "The Fellowship of the
          Divine Life" - the manifestation thereof 1:1-2; the divine fellowship
          1:3-4; the condition of fellowship = confession of sins 1:5-2:2; the
          Loving of God and the brothers 2:3-11. Then I believe the Divine
          Anointing from 1 John 2:12-27 is the outflow of that fellowship and
          love bringing us to Oneness, and when you then come together as the
          corporate body of Christ (The Anointed One flows the anointing) with
          that dellowship in your heart only Awesome things can happen. Your
          expectation is His invitation to reveal His Glory. Put off the old -
          Put on the NEW Eph 4:22-32; walk and live in the Spirit (Rom 8); Put
          on Christ and make no provision for the flesh. Prayer, Abiding in the
          Word, walking in Love and forgiveness, having a right spirit and
          attitude are only a few keys we have in maintaining the Oneness of
          Spirit. When we as the church of the Lord Jesus Christ return to our
          first Love and the world sees how much we are in Love with our Savior
          - The unsaved will run to meet our Jesus. The Love of God binds us
          together in relationship and trust because Psalm 133 is a REALITY in
          our lives. Love is the key to the last day church being unified
          PASSION - PURPOSE - POWER.
