      <h1>Performance Orientation</h1>
      <p>
        But God shows and clearly proves His [own] love for us by the fact that
        while we were still sinners, Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) dies
        for us. Romans 5:8

      <h2>PERFORMANCE ORIENTATION</h2>
      <p><i>(John & Paula Sandford, "Transformation of the Inner Man")</i></p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Gal. 3:1-14 - You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before
          your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. I
          would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the
          Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? Are
          you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now
          trying to finish by means of the flesh? Have you experienced so much
          in vain—if it really was in vain? So again I ask, does God give you
          his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by
          your believing what you heard? So also Abraham “believed God, and it
          was credited to him as righteousness.” Understand, then, that those
          who have faith are children of Abraham. Scripture foresaw that God
          would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in
          advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.” So
          those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of
          faith. For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as
          it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do
          everything written in the Book of the Law.” Clearly no one who relies
          on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live
          by faith.” The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says,
          “The person who does these things will live by them.” Christ redeemed
          us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is
          written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.” He redeemed us in
          order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles
          through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of
          the Spirit.</i

          Genesis 3:1-13, 21 - Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the
          wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God
          really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’? ” The
          woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the
          garden, but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is
          in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will
          die.’” “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman.
          “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and
          you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” When the woman saw that
          the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and
          also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also
          gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the
          eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked;
          so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
          Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was
          walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the
          LORD God among the trees of the garden. But the LORD God called to the
          man, “Where are you?” He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I
          was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.” And he said, “Who told you
          that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you
          not to eat from? ” The man said, “The woman you put here with me —she
          gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” Then the LORD God
          said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The
          serpent deceived me, and I ate.” 21.The LORD God made garments of skin
          for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
