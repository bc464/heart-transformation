      <h1>Jealousy</h1>
      <p>
        For wherever there is jealousy (envy) and contention (rivalry and
        selfish ambition), there will also be confucion (unrest, disharmony,
        rebellion) and all sorts of evil and vile practices. James 3:16-17

          Jealousy leads to hate - murder, severed relationships, loss of love
          and trust. When we are jeolous, self-pity comes over us, fears,
          stubbornness, suspiciousness and we plot evil. Jealousy is a fruit of
          bitterness. The antidote to jealousy is forgiveness and love.

        <p>Examples of jealousy in the Bible:</p>
        <p>
          Prov. 14:30 - A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots
          the bones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Song of Solomon 8:6 - Place me like a seal over your heart, like a
          seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy
          unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty
          flame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 27:4 - Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand
          before jealousy?
        </p>
        <p>
          Num. 11:26-30 - However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad,
          had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did
          not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they
          prophesied in the camp. A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and
          Medad are prophesying in the camp.” Joshua son of Nun, who had been
          Moses’ aide since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop
          them!” But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that
          all the LORD’s people were prophets and that the LORD would put his
          Spirit on them!” Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the
          camp.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Sam. 18:6-13 - When the men were returning home after David had
          killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel
          to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with
          timbrels and lyres. As they danced, they sang: “Saul has slain his
          thousands, and David his tens of thousands.” Saul was very angry; this
          refrain displeased him greatly. “They have credited David with tens of
          thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands. What more can he
          get but the kingdom? ” And from that time on Saul kept a close eye on
          David. The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully on Saul.
          He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the lyre, as
          he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand and he hurled it, saying
          to himself, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice.
          Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had
          departed from Saul. So he sent David away from him and gave him
          command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their
          campaigns.

          James 3:13-17 - Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show
          it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from
          wisdom. But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your
          hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. Such “wisdom” does
          not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. For
          where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and
          every evil practice. But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of
          all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy
          and good fruit, impartial and sincere.

          Miriam, Cain and Abel, Saul and David, Esua and Jacob. Gen.
          37:1-12(Joseph) - cob lived in the land where his father had stayed,
          the land of Canaan. This is the account of Jacob’s family line.
          Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his
          brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s
          wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them. Now Israel
          loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born
          to him in his old age; and he made an ornate robe for him. When his
          brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they
          hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. Joseph had a dream,
          and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. He
          said to them, “Listen to this dream I had: We were binding sheaves of
          grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright,
          while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.” His
          brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you
          actually rule us?” And they hated him all the more because of his
          dream and what he had said. Then he had another dream, and he told it
          to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this
          time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” When
          he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and
          said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your
          brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?” His
          brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.

      <h3>WHY DO WE GET JEALOUS</h3>
      <p>
        Is it because someone is getting something that we want - is it pride?
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          We can get jeolous of all sorts of things, such as: Possessions, home,
          children, talents, natural gifts, abilities, friendships, looks,
          clothes, personality, ministry, their parents, education,
          denomination, appearance of a person, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most often the door to a spirit of jealousy is opened during
          childhood.

      <h3>TO OVERCOME JEALOUSY STUDY</h3>
      <p>
        1 Cor. 12:12-28 - Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all
        its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all
        baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles,
        slave or free —and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. Even so
        the body is not made up of one part but of many. Now if the foot should
        say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it would
        not for that reason stop being part of the body. And if the ear should
        say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it would
        not for that reason stop being part of the body. If the whole body were
        an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an
        ear, where would the sense of smell be? But in fact God has placed the
        parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. If
        they were all one part, where would the body be? As it is, there are
        many parts, but one body. The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need
        you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!” On the
        contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are
        indispensable, and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat
        with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated
        with special modesty, while our presentable parts need no special
        treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to
        the parts that lacked it, so that there should be no division in the
        body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If
        one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored,
        every part rejoices with it. Now you are the body of Christ, and each
        one of you is a part of it. And God has placed in the church first of
        all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts
        of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues.

          We are in a covenant relationship with each other. We are one in

          cannot say it is 'mine' but 'ours' because we are one in Spirit. No
          one is more important before the Lord - we have different functions,
          but not importance, and we need each other.

            As we have a passion to see God being glorified and His Kingdom
            being extended - we will take our eyes off the person or 'vessel'
            and put them onto God then there will be no room for jealousy. We
            get jealous when we don't see our worth in God's eyes - when we are
            not fully fulfilling our function within the body and being fully
            fulfilled.

            God is going to ask me one day what did you do with what I gave you,

            binding ourselves as well as the other person when we are jealous -
            and both will be losers and God's work and glory will be hindered.

            We are free from jealousy when a brother or sister gets honour and
            we can rejoice with them knowning we are one with them, so in fact
            we can 'share' in the honour - but if we grind our teeth because
            they have something we want; then we are still bound by a spirit of
            jealousy.
