      <h2>HEALING SEXUAL WOUNDS</h2>
      <p>
        It goes without saying that a big hindrance to the one-flesh
        relationshi[p would be unfaithfulness or immorality. Let's take a look
        at what the Word of God has to say about it.
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Rom 1:20-32 - For since the creation of the world God’s invisible
          qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen,
          being understood from what has been made, so that people are without
          excuse. For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God
          nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their
          foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they
          became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images
          made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and
          reptiles. Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their
          hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one
          another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped
          and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever
          praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.
          Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural
          ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with
          women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed
          shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due
          penalty for their error. Furthermore, just as they did not think it
          worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a
          depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. They have
          become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and
          depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice.
          They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and
          boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;
          they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. Although
          they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve
          death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve
          of those who practice them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark 7:21-23 - For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that
          evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed,
          malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All
          these evils come from inside and defile a person.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Tim 2:22 - Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness,
          faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a
          pure heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 4:14-15 - Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in
          the way of evildoers. Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and
          go on your way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 5:3-23 - For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and
          her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as gall,
          sharp as a double-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps
          lead straight to the grave. She gives no thought to the way of life;
          her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it. Now then, my
          sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say. Keep to a path
          far from her, do not go near the door of her house, lest you lose your
          honor to others and your dignity to one who is cruel, lest strangers
          feast on your wealth and your toil enrich the house of another. At the
          end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.
          You will say, “How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned
          correction! I would not obey my teachers or turn my ear to my
          instructors. And I was soon in serious trouble in the assembly of
          God’s people.” Drink water from your own cistern, running water from
          your own well. Should your springs overflow in the streets, your
          streams of water in the public squares? Let them be yours alone, never
          to be shared with strangers. May your fountain be blessed, and may you
          rejoice in the wife of your youth. A loving doe, a graceful deer — may
          her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be intoxicated with her
          love. Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife? Why embrace
          the bosom of a wayward woman? For your ways are in full view of the
          LORD, and he examines all your paths. The evil deeds of the wicked
          ensnare them; the cords of their sins hold them fast. For lack of
          discipline they will die, led astray by their own great
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 6:20 - My son, keep your father’s command and do not forsake
          your mother’s teaching. Prov. 7:5 - They will keep you from the
          adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 7:6-27 - At the window of my house I looked down through the
          lattice. I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a
          youth who had no sense. He was going down the street near her corner,
          walking along in the direction of her house at twilight, as the day
          was fading, as the dark of night set in. Then out came a woman to meet
          him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent. (She is unruly
          and defiant, her feet never stay at home; now in the street, now in
          the squares, at every corner she lurks.) She took hold of him and
          kissed him and with a brazen face she said: “Today I fulfilled my
          vows, and I have food from my fellowship offering at home. So I came
          out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you! I have covered
          my bed with colored linens from Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with
          myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. Come, let’s drink deeply of love till
          morning; let’s enjoy ourselves with love! My husband is not at home;
          he has gone on a long journey. He took his purse filled with money and
          will not be home till full moon.” With persuasive words she led him
          astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. All at once he followed
          her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a
          noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a
          snare, little knowing it will cost him his life. Now then, my sons,
          listen to me; pay attention to what I say. Do not let your heart turn
          to her ways or stray into her paths. Many are the victims she has
          brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. Her house is a highway to
          the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 8: 4-13 - “To you, O people, I call out; I raise my voice to all
          mankind. You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, set
          your hearts on it. Listen, for I have trustworthy things to say; I
          open my lips to speak what is right. My mouth speaks what is true, for
          my lips detest wickedness. All the words of my mouth are just; none of
          them is crooked or perverse. To the discerning all of them are right;
          they are upright to those who have found knowledge. Choose my
          instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold, for
          wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can
          compare with her. “I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess
          knowledge and discretion. To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate
          pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph 4:18-25 - They are darkened in their understanding and separated
          from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to
          the hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity, they have
          given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of
          impurity, and they are full of greed. That, however, is not the way of
          life you learned when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in
          accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught, with
          regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is
          being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the
          attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like
          God in true righteousness and holiness. Therefore each of you must put
          off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all
          members of one body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job 31:1-12 - I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at
          a young woman. For what is our lot from God above, our heritage from
          the Almighty on high? Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for
          those who do wrong? Does he not see my ways and count my every step?
          “If I have walked with falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit —
          let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless
          — if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by
          my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled, then may others eat what I
          have sown, and may my crops be uprooted. “If my heart has been enticed
          by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor’s door, then may my
          wife grind another man’s grain, and may other men sleep with her. For
          that would have been wicked, a sin to be judged. It is a fire that
          burns to Destruction; it would have uprooted my harvest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deut 22:5 - A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear
          women’s clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt 15:18-19 - But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come
          from the heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil
          thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony,
          slander.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Cor 6:9-11 - Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the
          kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor
          idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor
          the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
          kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were
          washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the
          Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rom 13:13-14 - Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in
          carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery,
          not in dissension and jealousy. Rather, clothe yourselves with the
          Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires
          of the flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph 5:1-10 - Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children
          and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself
          up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But among you
          there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of
          impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy
          people. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking,
          which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. For of this you can
          be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an
          idolater —has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let
          no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s
          wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners
          with them. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the
          Lord. Live as children of light (for the fruit of the light consists
          in all goodness, righteousness and truth) and find out what pleases
          the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rom 6:1-4 - What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that
          grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin;
          how can we live in it any longer? Or don’t you know that all of us who
          were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were
          therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that,
          just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
          Father, we too may live a new life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rom 8:5-18 - Those who live according to the flesh have their minds
          set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with
          the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. The mind
          governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is
          life and peace. The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it
          does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so. Those who are in the
          realm of the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are not in the
          realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the
          Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of
          Christ, they do not belong to Christ. But if Christ is in you, then
          even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit
          gives life because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of him who
          raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from
          the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his
          Spirit who lives in you. Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an
          obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it. For if
          you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit
          you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live. For those
          who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. The Spirit
          you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again;
          rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to
          sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit himself
          testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. Now if we are
          children, then we are heirs —heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if
          indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in
          his glory. Present Suffering and Future Glory I consider that our
          present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be
          revealed in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Thess 4:3-8 - It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that
          you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to
          control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in
          passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God; and that in this
          matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister.
          The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you
          and warned you before. For God did not call us to be impure, but to
          live a holy life. Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does
          not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lev 18 - The LORD said to Moses, “Speak to the Israelites and say to
          them: ‘I am the LORD your God. You must not do as they do in Egypt,
          where you used to live, and you must not do as they do in the land of
          Canaan, where I am bringing you. Do not follow their practices. You
          must obey my laws and be careful to follow my decrees. I am the LORD
          your God. Keep my decrees and laws, for the person who obeys them will
          live by them. I am the LORD. “‘No one is to approach any close
          relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD. “‘Do not dishonor
          your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your
          mother; do not have relations with her. “‘Do not have sexual relations
          with your father’s wife; that would dishonor your father. “‘Do not
          have sexual relations with your sister, either your father’s daughter
          or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or
          elsewhere. “‘Do not have sexual relations with your son’s daughter or
          your daughter’s daughter; that would dishonor you. “‘Do not have
          sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your
          father; she is your sister. “‘Do not have sexual relations with your
          father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative. “‘Do not have
          sexual relations with your mother’s sister, because she is your
          mother’s close relative. “‘Do not dishonor your father’s brother by
          approaching his wife to have sexual relations; she is your aunt. “‘Do
          not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s
          wife; do not have relations with her. “‘Do not have sexual relations
          with your brother’s wife; that would dishonor your brother. “‘Do not
          have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. Do not have
          sexual relations with either her son’s daughter or her daughter’s
          daughter; they are her close relatives. That is wickedness. “‘Do not
          take your wife’s sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with
          her while your wife is living. “‘Do not approach a woman to have
          sexual relations during the uncleanness of her monthly period. “‘Do
          not have sexual relations with your neighbor’s wife and defile
          yourself with her. “‘Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed
          to Molek, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the
          LORD. “‘Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a
          woman; that is detestable. “‘Do not have sexual relations with an
          animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself
          to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion.
          “‘Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how
          the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled.
          Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the land
          vomited out its inhabitants. But you must keep my decrees and my laws.
          The native-born and the foreigners residing among you must not do any
          of these detestable things, for all these things were done by the
          people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled.
          And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out
          the nations that were before you. “‘Everyone who does any of these
          detestable things—such persons must be cut off from their people. Keep
          my requirements and do not follow any of the detestable customs that
          were practiced before you came and do not defile yourselves with them.
          I am the LORD your God."

          Why does God hit immorality so hard? - we are a temple of the Holy
          Spirit - damaging our soul - death. God created us so that we can only
          relate to one person of the opposite sex in the fullness of a marraige
          relationship. We are members of ONE Body and we stand in relationship
          to God as the bride to the BRIDEGROOM. In a sense mongamy is a
          preparation for faithfulness to ONE GOD.

          Everybody longs to give themselves completely to someone to have a

          'No, not until you are satisfied, fulfilled and content with living -

            There may be anger and rebellion toward parents, or a need to throw
            oneself away to prevent one's parents from rejoicing in their
            child's glory.
          </li>
          <li>Or a need to punish the parents.</li>
          <li>
            Or a hunger for a father's love, so that the touch of a man became
            so tonic, a "no" could not be spoken.
          </li>
          <li>
            Or simply the lack of a functioning conscience because the father
            had never been 'there'.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most often in a woman who cannot be moral, there is lack of a
            father's expressed love, and a consequent lack of love and
            respectful care for her own being. She believes she is worthless
            anyway; so why not be the tool of any man that comes along?
            Especially sonce to be touched seems to reach such vacant and needy
            places deep inside.
          </li>

            Or a need to prove again and again that men, or women, are "like
            that" (like their judgement against one or both parents) or the
            opposite sex.

            Repent of all sexual sin, whether before marraige, during marraige
            and any perverted sexual activity, even if it has been lust in one's
            heart (Matt 5:28 - But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman
            lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.)
            receive the cleansing blood of Jesus
            <p>
              1 John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and
              will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
            </p>
            <p>
              John 8:1-11 - but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. At dawn he
              appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered
              around him, and he sat down to teach them. The teachers of the law
              and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made
              her stand before the group and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman
              was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us
              to stone such women. Now what do you say?” They were using this
              question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But
              Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his
              finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and
              said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first
              to throw a stone at her.” Again he stooped down and wrote on the
              ground. At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time,
              the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman
              still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman,
              where are they? Has no one condemned you?” “No one, sir,” she
              said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and
              leave your life of sin.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Isa. 44:22-23 - I have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your
              sins like the morning mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed
              you.” Sing for joy, you heavens, for the LORD has done this; shout
              aloud, you earth beneath. Burst into song, you mountains, you
              forests and all your trees, for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, he
              displays his glory in Israel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jer 31:34 - No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to
              one another, ‘Know the LORD,’ because they will all know me, from
              the least of them to the greatest,” declares the LORD. “For I will
              forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Isa 55:6-9 - Seek the LORD while he may be found; call on him
              while he is near. Let the wicked forsake their ways and the
              unrighteous their thoughts. Let them turn to the LORD, and he will
              have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will freely pardon.
              “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
              ways,” declares the LORD. “As the heavens are higher than the
              earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than
              your thoughts.

            You would need to forgive anyone who has wounded you sexually,
            whether incest, rape, premarital sexual union or adultery, whether
            through fondling, petting or exposure, or if you were taken
            advantage of sexually, even if you consented to the relationship and
            were used and discarded, whether it is a lover or a previous spouse.
          </li>
          <li>
            You need to forgive yourself whether you were a willing partner or
            inncocent victim. If it happened when you were a child, forgive the
            little child in you and love and accept yourself. Ask Jesus to
            restore your virginity or innocence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sever all ungodly soul ties. Anytime the mind, will and emotions are
            deeply involved in a relationship, a soul tie is formed.
            <p>
              1 Sam 18:1 - After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan
              became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gen 34:2-3 - When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of
              that area, saw her, he took her and raped her. His heart was drawn
              to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke
              tenderly to her. 8 But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his
              heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.
            </p>
            <p>
              Break all ungodly soul ties, so that you and the other person can
              be free from each emotionally and mentally, so that any ungodly
              hold the relationship has on you will be ended.

            Take authority over any spirit that were assigned as a result of
            sexual sin. Demonic holds can create lust, shame, promiscuity,
            impotence, frigidity, etc. Also take authority over any spirits that
            can be assigned to attack your children or down the bloodline to
            future generations.
