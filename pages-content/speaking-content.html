      <h2>SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN LOVE</h2>
      <p>
        "Oftern we speak the truth, but it would not be in love! Other times we
        might not even apeak the truth at all, because we are afraid to speak
        up!" - Jo Anderson
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          "But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into
          Him, who is the head, even Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Amplified "Rather, let our lives lovingly express truth (in all
          things, speaking truly, dealing truly, living truly). Enfolded in
          love, let us grow up in every way and in all things into Him Who is
          the Head, (even) Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed one)." Eph. 4:15

          One big hindrance is being a 'doormat' or allowing others to
          'intimidate' us.

        <h4>
          Jo Anderson's definition of a doormat from the "Renewing Love" course:
        </h4>
        <p>
          "They allow one or more persons to dominate them verbally,
          emotionally, spiritually or physically. Lacking personal worth, they
          feel they feel they must allow such treatment, not realizing their
          value in God's sight they oftern accept the abuse because of feelings
          of guilt over past sins in their life that have not been dealt with
          and it is as though they need [unishment to atone for their sins.
          There is a fear underlying their behaviour which keeps them from
          standing up to a particular individual. Feeling suppressed by this
          individual, they will often retaliate subconsciously by dominating
          some other person in their life. If they accept physical abuse they
          most likely dwell upon self destruction when the going gets rough.
          They obey with rotten attitudes out of fear in their heart, meanwhile
          hating themselves all the more every time they allow themselves to
          behave in this manner."

        <h4>Jo's definition of intimidation:</h4>
        <p>
          "it is a state of mind in which I allow another person's value,
          opinions, prejudices, ideas, actions, lack of action and personality
          make me feel defensive. I may even feel unworthy or unknowledgable -
          even frightened and silences to the point of shame. Intimidating
          experiences can also leave me feeling put down, insulted, misquoted,
          misrepresented, demoralized, bought-off, threatened and cheated where
          a sense of impotency seems overwhelming and unsolvable. Oftern, I may
          feel a terrible sense of inadequancy and I am unable to cope with
          another's wit, intelligence, talent, dogmatic or overbearing ways,
          foolishness, rebellion, anger, abuse, lashing out, ethics, logic,
          assumptions, or another's expectations. Our intimidation is usually
          typified by feelings of "I should have said or done this" or "next
          time I will say or do the following." One is left with little
          creativity, productivity or self-worth. Great anger and resentment can
          well up in us if we do not deal with these frustrations.""

          Ecc. 7:26 - I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare,

      <h3>SCRIPTURE ON FEAR</h3>
      <p>Behind fear is Pride</p>
      <p>FEAR - False Evidence Appearing Real</p>
      <p>FAITH - For All I Trust Him</p>
      <p>
        God's love drives out fear. Be secure in the love of God. It sets us
        free of the fear of man. Fear causes us to draw back / hold back.
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Prov. 3:24-26 - When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you
          lie down, your sleep will be sweet. Have no fear of sudden disaster or
          of the ruin that overtakes the wicked, for the LORD will be at your
          side and will keep your foot from being snared.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Tim. 1:7 - For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but
          gives us power, love and self-discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isa. 41:10-13 - So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed,
          for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold
          you with my righteous right hand. “All who rage against you will
          surely be ashamed and disgraced; those who oppose you will be as
          nothing and perish. Though you search for your enemies, you will not
          find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all.
          For I am the LORD your God who takes hold of your right hand and says
          to you, Do not fear; I will help
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 10:27 - The fear of the LORD adds length to life, but the years
          of the wicked are cut short.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job 3:25 - What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened
          to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jer. 17:5-8 - This is what the LORD says: “Cursed is the one who
          trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart
          turns away from the LORD. That person will be like a bush in the
          wastelands; they will not see prosperity when it comes. They will
          dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one
          lives. “But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose
          confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water
          that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat
          comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of
          drought and never fails to bear fruit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt. 10:28 - Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot
          kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul
          and body in hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Peter 3:13-18 - Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do
          good? But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are
          blessed. “Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened.” But in
          your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an
          answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that
          you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear
          conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good
          behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. For it is better,
          if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. For
          Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous,
          to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in
          the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 46:1-3 - God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in
          trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the
          mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and
          foam and the mountains quake with their surging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isa. 12:2 - Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be
          afraid. The LORD, the LORD himself, is my strength and my defense; he
          has become my salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt. 6:23,25,33-34 - But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body
          will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness,
          how great is that darkness! 25 Therefore I tell you, do not worry
          about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what
          you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than
          clothes? 33-34 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and
          all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry
          about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has
          enough trouble of its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 29:25 - Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts
          in the LORD is kept safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          John 14:27 - Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not
          give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and
          do not be afraid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rom. 8:15-28 - The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so
          that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought
          about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The
          Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.
          Now if we are children, then we are heirs —heirs of God and co-heirs
          with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may
          also share in his glory. Present Suffering and Future Glory I consider
          that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory
          that will be revealed in us. For the creation waits in eager
          expectation for the children of God to be revealed. For the creation
          was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will
          of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be
          liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and
          glory of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been
          groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
          Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,
          groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the
          redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. But hope
          that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?
          But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.
          In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know
          what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us
          through wordless groans. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind
          of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in
          accordance with the will of God. And we know that in all things God
          works for the good of those who love him, who have been called
          according to his purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psa. 27 - The LORD is my light and my salvation — whom shall I fear?
          The LORD is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid? When
          the wicked advance against me to devour me, it is my enemies and my
          foes who will stumble and fall. Though an army besiege me, my heart
          will not fear; though war break out against me, even then I will be
          confident. One thing I ask from the LORD, this only do I seek: that I
          may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze on
          the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple. For in the day
          of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in
          the shelter of his sacred tent and set me high upon a rock. Then my
          head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his sacred
          tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music
          to the LORD. Hear my voice when I call, LORD; be merciful to me and
          answer me. My heart says of you, “Seek his face! ” Your face, LORD, I
          will seek. Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant
          away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake
          me, God my Savior. Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD
          will receive me. Teach me your way, LORD; lead me in a straight path
          because of my oppressors. Do not turn me over to the desire of my
          foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, spouting malicious
          accusations. I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of
          the LORD in the land of the living. Wait for the LORD; be strong and
          take heart and wait for the LORD.

          1 John 4:18 - There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out

          Isa. 8:12,13 - Do not call conspiracy everything this people calls a
          conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it. The LORD
          Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are

        <p>
          James 1:19-21 - My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this:
          Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become
          angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God
          desires. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so

          Eccl. 7:8b-9 - The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and

          2 Tim. 2:23-26 - Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid

          servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to
          teach, not resentful. Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope
          that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the
          truth, and that they will come to their senses and escape from the

          Prov. 16:18 - Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a
          fall.

          Prov. 29:25 - Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts
          in the LORD is kept safe.

          Prov. 15:33 - Wisdom’s instruction is to fear the LORD, and humility

          1 Peter 5:5-7 - In the same way, you who are younger, submit
          yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility
          toward one another, because, “God opposes the proud but shows favor to
          the humble.” Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand,
          that he may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him
          because he cares for you.
        </p>

          Isa. 66:2 - Has not my hand made all these things, and so they came
          into being?” declares the LORD. “These are the ones I look on with
          favor: those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at
          my word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dan. 4:30-37 - he said, “Is not this the great Babylon I have built as
          the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my
          majesty?” Even as the words were on his lips, a voice came from
          heaven, “This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your
          royal authority has been taken from you. You will be driven away from
          people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like
          the ox. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that
          the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them
          to anyone he wishes.” Immediately what had been said about
          Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate
          grass like the ox. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until
          his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the
          claws of a bird. At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my
          eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the
          Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion
          is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to
          generation. All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He
          does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the
          earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: “What have you
          done?” At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and
          splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers
          and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became
          even greater than before. Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and
          glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and
          all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to
          humble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt. 23:12 - For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and
          those who humble themselves will be exalted.
        </p>
        <p>
          James 4:6-10 - But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says:
          “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.” Submit
          yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
          Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you
          sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn and
          wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble
          yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.

          Matt. 5:33-37 - “Again, you have heard that it was said to the people
          long ago, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows
          you have made.’ But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by
          heaven, for it is God’s throne; or by the earth, for it is his
          footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And
          do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or
          black. All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond
          this comes from the evil one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lev. 5:4 - or if anyone thoughtlessly takes an oath to do anything,
          whether good or evil (in any matter one might carelessly swear about)
          even though they are unaware of it, but then they learn of it and
          realize their guilt

          Num. 30:3-16 - “When a young woman still living in her father’s
          household makes a vow to the LORD or obligates herself by a pledge and
          her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her, then
          all her vows and every pledge by which she obligated herself will
          stand. But if her father forbids her when he hears about it, none of
          her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand; the
          LORD will release her because her father has forbidden her. “If she
          marries after she makes a vow or after her lips utter a rash promise
          by which she obligates herself and her husband hears about it but says
          nothing to her, then her vows or the pledges by which she obligated
          herself will stand. But if her husband forbids her when he hears about
          it, he nullifies the vow that obligates her or the rash promise by
          which she obligates herself, and the LORD will release her. “Any vow
          or obligation taken by a widow or divorced woman will be binding on
          her. “If a woman living with her husband makes a vow or obligates
          herself by a pledge under oath and her husband hears about it but says
          nothing to her and does not forbid her, then all her vows or the
          pledges by which she obligated herself will stand. But if her husband
          nullifies them when he hears about them, then none of the vows or
          pledges that came from her lips will stand. Her husband has nullified
          them, and the LORD will release her. Her husband may confirm or
          nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny herself. But if
          her husband says nothing to her about it from day to day, then he
          confirms all her vows or the pledges binding on her. He confirms them
          by saying nothing to her when he hears about them. If, however, he
          nullifies them some time after he hears about them, then he must bear
          the consequences of her wrongdoing.” These are the regulations the
          LORD gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife,
          and between a father and his young daughter still living at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deut. 23:21-23 - If you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not be
          slow to pay it, for the LORD your God will certainly demand it of you
          and you will be guilty of sin. But if you refrain from making a vow,
          you will not be guilty. Whatever your lips utter you must be sure to
          do, because you made your vow freely to the LORD your God with your
          own mouth.

          "An inner vow is a determination set by the mind and heart into all
          the being in early life. Vows we make now also affect us, but an inner
          vow is one set into us as children, ussually forgotten. Our inner
          being persistently retains such programming no matter what changes of
          mind and heart may later come about. The clear mark of an inner vow is
          that it resists the normal growing up process. We do not grow out of
          them as we do most childish things."
        </p>
        <p>
          They come into effect at the due time or season usually later on in
          life when right person or situation may trigger them off. The good as
          well as the bad vows need to be brought to the Lord and dealt with, so
          that we are not hindered by the programming of our flesh, but by the
          Spirit of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is always bitterness, fear or ill feelings or anger behind an
          inner vow and / or of wanting to be in control.

          <li>
            "I will always be kind / nice" - this could also hinder you from
            being honest or / and real. Jesus was not always "nice", when we
            think of the way He spoke to the Pharisees.

            "You will never hurt me like that again - I am not going to let that

            on top of everything - cut out feeling, limit joy."
          </li>
          <li>
            "I will never hurt another's feelings. I would never be angry." Stop
            one from being honest with oneself regarding anger.

          Repent of each and every one as the Holy Spirit shows you. Deal with
          the roots, clean it out by applying the blood of Jesus, forgive,
          receive His forgiveness, and break the inner vow by using authority in
          Jesus Name, and asking the Holy Spirit to re-programme you from within
          to free you so that you can respond in the way that Jesus would have
          you, also receive healing from Christ Jesus.
