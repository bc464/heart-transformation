      <h1>Dealing with Bitterness</h1>
      <p>
        Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along
        with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another,
        forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. Ephesians
        4:31-32

      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          1 John 4:15-21 - If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God,
          God lives in them and they in God. And so we know and rely on the love
          God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and
          God in them. This is how love is made complete among us so that we
          will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like
          Jesus. There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear,
          because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made
          perfect in love. We love because he first loved us. Whoever claims to
          love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not
          love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God,
          whom they have not seen. And he has given us this command: Anyone who
          loves God must also love their brother and sister.
        </p>
        <p>
          Romans 5:5 - And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has
          been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been
          given to us.
        </p>
        <p><i>"It's not what you eat, but what's eating you!"</i></p>

        <p>
          "Where there is bitterness, God's love cannot be. I will be hindering
          the spirit of God form flowing through me. It will bind the other
          person, as well as myself, as well as effect my relationship with God"
          (<i>quote from Jo Anderson</i>).
        </p>

        <p>
          I can choose to hold on to an offense, or I can choose to forgive. As
          i keep my eyes on Jesus, and focus on how He has forgiven me through
          grace then in the light of His forgiveness of me and through His
          strength, I can then forgive and let go! And then bless the person.
        </p>

        <p>
          "God never demands anything from us unless He gives it at the same
          time."
        </p>
        <p>
          Are our roots going into bitterness or into God's love? Wherever our
          roots are - that is where we will get our nourishment.

              1 Samuel 18:8-12, 29-30 - Saul was very angry; this refrain
              displeased him greatly. “They have credited David with tens of
              thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands. What more can
              he get but the kingdom? ” And from that time on Saul kept a close
              eye on David. The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully
              on Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing
              the lyre, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand and he
              hurled it, saying to himself, “I'll pin David to the wall.” But
              David eluded him twice. Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD
              was with David but had departed from Saul. 29-30 - When Saul
              realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal
              loved David, Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained
              his enemy the rest of his days. The Philistine commanders
              continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met
              with more success than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name
              became well known.

              Matt. 18:15-35 - “If your brother or sister sins, go and point out
              their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you,
              you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or
              two others along, so that "every matter may be established by the
              testimony of two or three witnesses." If they still refuse to
              listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even
              to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
              “Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in
              heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
              “Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about
              anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in
              heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with
              them.” The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant Then Peter came to
              Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother
              or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?” Jesus answered,
              “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. “Therefore,
              the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts
              with his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him
              ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not
              able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his
              children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. “At this
              the servant fell on his knees before him. "Be patient with me," he
              begged, "and I will pay back everything." The servant's master
              took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. “But when that
              servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him
              a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him.
              "Pay back what you owe me!" he demanded. “His fellow servant fell
              to his knees and begged him, "Be patient with me, and I will pay
              it back." “But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man
              thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other
              servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and
              told their master everything that had happened. “Then the master
              called the servant in. "You wicked servant," he said, "I canceled
              all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you
              have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?" In
              anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured,
              until he should pay back all he owed. “This is how my heavenly
              Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or
              sister from your heart.”
