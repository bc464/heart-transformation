          "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall

      <h2>LEAVING - CLEANING - ONE FLESH</h2>
      <p>
        Genesis 2:24 - "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother
        and shall become united and cleave to his wife, and they shall become
        one flesh."
      </p>
      <p>
        Psa. 45:10 - Listen, daughter, and pay careful attention: Forget your
        people and your fatherâ€™s house.

        <h3>LEAVING</h3>
        <p>
          The 3 legs of marraige, like a 3-legged pot. If the one is not there
          the pot falls over. If the man or woman fails to leave, then the
          cleaving cannot take place, and the 3rd stage cannot even be entered.
          They cannot become one flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biblical command to honour one's father and mother, no longer
          involves obedience when married, You no longer owe obedience although
          you will honour them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the married couple, honouring parents refers to attitudes and
          services given in proper priority after duties given to mate and
          children - not before.
        </p>
        <p>
          A wife should say to her husband the same words Ruth said to Naomi,
          "Where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your
          people shall be my people, and your God, my God" (Ruth 1:16b).

        <h3>CLEAVING</h3>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Cleaving means love, but love of a special kind. It is love which
            has made a decision, and which is no longer a groping and seeking
            love. Love which cleaves, is a mature love, love which has decided
            to remain faithful - faithful to one person. - and to share with
            this one person one's whole life."</i

            joined together, keep fast, overtake, pursue hard, stick to, take,

      <h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS FOR BETTER COMMUNICATION</h3>
      <p><i>("Marriage Takes More than Love")</i></p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          The following questions can be used to gain knowledge of each other
          whether as an engaged couple, as a newly married husband and wife, or
          even as "old married folk". In order for them to be most profitable,
          set apart some time for exploring feelings; then take a section which
          intrigues you and travel you and travel new roads of adventure,
          penetrating into unxplored territory of your minds and hearts. Use the
          questions to search, observe, analyse, and probe new vistas.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to consider other questions in the same categories,
          consult Joseph B Henry's Fulfilment in Marraige(Westwood, New
          Jersey:Flemming H.Revell Company, 1966), pages 56-79. The questions in
          this section are partly our and partly adapted from Henry's book.
        </p>

        <p>
          If there are difficult areas of communication in your marraige, begin
          with the easy topics...and use only the positive questions at first.
          Then progress to the topics you have problems discussing, and finally
          to those questions which may be painful but are imperative to explore.
          Begin with prayer...end will prayer. Let God be the third Person
          sitting in on these dialogues. And remember, with God all things are
          possible.

          <li>
            On a scale from 1 to 100 (with 100 being high), how would you rate

          <li>
            What, in your opinion, is the difference between argument and

            When and on what subjects do you feel I can be stubborn and

            Do you feel our silent communication is good? In other words, can
            you tell what I am thinking (by expression, nods, gestures, or just
            through waves) in a group or just the two of us when we don't say
            anything? How could we improve on this "language without words."
