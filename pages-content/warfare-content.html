        He who overcomes (is victorious), I will grant him to sit beside Me on
        My throne, as I Myself overcame (was victorious) and sat down beside My

        <p>
          Eph 6:10-13 * - Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty
          power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand
          against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and
          blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the
          powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in
          the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that
          when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and
          after you have done everything, to stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gal. 5:16-22 So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify
          the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to
          the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in
          conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want.
          But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. The acts
          of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;
          idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,
          selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies,
          and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like
          this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit
          is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
          gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb 11:6 - And without faith it is impossible to please God, because
          anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he
          rewards those who earnestly seek him.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 John 2:15-17 - Do not love the world or anything in the world. If
          anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For
          everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
          and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.
          The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God
          lives forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Cor 3:5-15 - What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only
          servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to
          each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has
          been making it grow. So neither the one who plants nor the one who
          waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. The one who
          plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be
          rewarded according to their own labor. For we are co-workers in God’s
          service; you are God’s field, God’s building. By the grace God has
          given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is
          building on it. But each one should build with care. For no one can
          lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus
          Christ. If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly
          stones, wood, hay or straw, their work will be shown for what it is,
          because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire,
          and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work. If what has
          been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. If it is
          burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even
          though only as one escaping through the flames.

          Dan. 10:12-13 - Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since
          the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to
          humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have
          come in response to them. But the prince of the Persian kingdom
          resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes,
          came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt 12:29 - Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and
          carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then
          he can plunder his house.

          2 Cor 4:4 - The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers,
          so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the
          glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          John 16:8-10 - When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the
          wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: about sin, because
          people do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going
          to the Father, where you can see me no longer;

          Isa. 25:6-10 - On this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare a feast
          of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine— the best of
          meats and the finest of wines. On this mountain he will destroy the
          shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations; he
          will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the
          tears from all faces; he will remove his people’s disgrace from all
          the earth. The LORD has spoken. In that day they will say, “Surely
          this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the LORD,
          we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.” The
          hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain; but Moab will be trampled
          in their land as straw is trampled down in the manure.

        <p>
          Ezek. 28:14-19 - You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I
          ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the
          fiery stones. You were blameless in your ways from the day you were
          created till wickedness was found in you. Through your widespread
          trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in
          disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub,
          from among the fiery stones. Your heart became proud on account of
          your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor.
          So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.
          By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your
          sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you,
          and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were
          watching. All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have
          come to a horrible end and will be no more. ’”
        </p>
        <p>
          Isa 14:11-15 - All your pomp has been brought down to the grave, along
          with the noise of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you and
          worms cover you. How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of
          the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low
          the nations! You said in your heart, “I will ascend to the heavens; I
          will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on
          the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will
          ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most
          High.” But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the
          depths of the pit.

        <p>
          Job 1:6-12 - One day the angels came to present themselves before the
          LORD, and Satan also came with them. The LORD said to Satan, “Where
          have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout
          the earth, going back and forth on it.” Then the LORD said to Satan,
          “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like
          him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”
          “Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. “Have you not put a
          hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have
          blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread
          throughout the land. But now stretch out your hand and strike
          everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.” The
          LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your
          power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Job 2:1-10 - On another day the angels came to present themselves
          before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself
          before him. And the LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”
          Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going
          back and forth on it.” Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you
          considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is
          blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he
          still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to
          ruin him without any reason.” “Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man
          will give all he has for his own life. But now stretch out your hand
          and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your
          face.” The LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands;
          but you must spare his life.” So Satan went out from the presence of
          the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his
          feet to the crown of his head. Then Job took a piece of broken pottery
          and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes. His wife said
          to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”
          He replied, “You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept
          good from God, and not trouble?” In all this, Job did not sin in what
          he said.

          Job 3:25 - What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened
          to me.

        <p>
          Matt 4:1-11 - Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to
          be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he
          was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of
          God, tell these stones to become bread.” Jesus answered, “It is
          written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that
          comes from the mouth of God.’” Then the devil took him to the holy
          city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are
          the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:
          “‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up
          in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a
          stone.’” Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord
          your God to the test.’” Again, the devil took him to a very high
          mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their
          splendor. “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down
          and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is
          written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’” Then the
          devil left him, and angels came and attended him.
        </p>
        <p>
          James 1:13-15 - When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.”
          For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each
          person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire
          and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin;
          and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.

        <p>
          Rev. 20:2-3, 7-10- He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is
          the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. He threw him
          into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from
          deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended.
          After that, he must be set free for a short time.Blessed and holy are
          those who share in the first resurrection. The Judgment of Satan When
          the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison
          and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the
          earth —Gog and Magog —and to gather them for battle. In number they
          are like the sand on the seashore. They marched across the breadth of
          the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves.
          But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil, who
          deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the
          beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented
          day and night for ever and ever.

        <p>
          John 8:44 - You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to
          carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning,
          not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies,
          he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of
          lies.

          John 10:10 - The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I

        <p>CLAIMING CHRIST'S POWER</p>
        <p>Phil. 4:13 - I can do all this through him who gives me strength.</p>
        <p>
          Col 1:10-24 - so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and
          please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in
          the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to
          his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience,
          and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share
          in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light. For he
          has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the
          kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the
          forgiveness of sins. The Supremacy of the Son of God The Son is the
          image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For in
          him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible
          and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all
          things have been created through him and for him. He is before all
          things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the
          body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the
          dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. For God was
          pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to
          reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in
          heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. Once you
          were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your
          evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body
          through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and
          free from accusation — if you continue in your faith, established and
          firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is
          the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every
          creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
          Paul’s Labor for the Church Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for
          you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to
          Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph 1:18-23 - I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in
          order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the
          riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, and his
          incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as
          the mighty strength he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and
          seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all
          rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is
          invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. And
          God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over
          everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who
          fills everything in every way.

          1 Cor 10:13 - No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to
          mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond
          what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a
          way out so that you can endure it.

        <p>
          Rom 5:8-10 - But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While
          we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been
          justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s
          wrath through him! For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were
          reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having
          been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!
        </p>
        <p>
          Rom. 8:19-25 - For the creation waits in eager expectation for the
          children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to
          frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who
          subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from
          its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the
          children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as
          in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. Not only so,
          but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan
          inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the
          redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. But hope
          that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?
          But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.

          Ps 19:1-8 - The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim
          the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night
          after night they reveal knowledge. They have no speech, they use no
          words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all
          the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens God
          has pitched a tent for the sun. It is like a bridegroom coming out of
          his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. It rises at
          one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is
          deprived of its warmth. The law of the LORD is perfect, refreshing the
          soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the
          simple. The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart.
          The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.

          2 Peter 1:3-4 - His divine power has given us everything we need for a
          godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory
          and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and
          precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the

          word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the
          right hand of the Majesty in heaven."

          Acts 19:11-19 - God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that
          even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the
          sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.
          Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the
          name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would
          say, “In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to
          come out.” Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing
          this. One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I
          know about, but who are you?” Then the man who had the evil spirit
          jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating
          that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. When this became
          known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized
          with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. Many
          of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had
          done. A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls
          together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of
          the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.

      <h4>* Scripture on Believers' Baptism</h4>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Rom 6 - What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace
          may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can
          we live in it any longer? Or don’t you know that all of us who were
          baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were
          therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that,
          just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
          Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with
          him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in
          a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified
          with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that
          we should no longer be slaves to sin — because anyone who has died has
          been set free from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we
          will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from
          the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.
          The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives,
          he lives to God. In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but
          alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your
          mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer any part
          of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer
          yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life;
          and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of
          righteousness. For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are
          not under the law, but under grace. Slaves to Righteousness What then?
          Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no
          means! Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as
          obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey —whether you are
          slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to
          righteousness? But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves
          to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching
          that has now claimed your allegiance. You have been set free from sin
          and have become slaves to righteousness. I am using an example from
          everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to
          offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing
          wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading
          to holiness. When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the
          control of righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that time from
          the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! But
          now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of
          God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal
          life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal
          life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

          Rom 7:1 - Do you not know, brothers and sisters —for I am speaking to

          Rom 7:4 - So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law

          1 John 5:4-12 - for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is
          the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. Who is it
          that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the
          Son of God. This is the one who came by water and blood —Jesus Christ.
          He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the
          Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are
          three that testify: the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three
          are in agreement. We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is
          greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about
          his Son. Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony.
          Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because
          they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. And
          this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is
          in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the
          Son of God does not have life.

          off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him
          in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith
          in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. When you were
          dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made
          you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the
          charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned
          us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed
          the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them,
          triumphing over them by the cross. - take note verse 12 'through your

          Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip
          baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the
          Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again,
          but went on his way rejoicing. Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and

          to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. Let our lord
          command his servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre.
          He will play when the evil spirit from God comes on you, and you will
          feel better.” So Saul said to his attendants, “Find someone who plays
          well and bring him to me.” One of the servants answered, “I have seen
          a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a
          brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And
          the LORD is with him.” Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said,
          “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep. ” So Jesse took a
          donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent
          them with his son David to Saul. David came to Saul and entered his
          service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his
          armor-bearers. Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Allow David to
          remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.” Whenever the spirit
          from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then
          relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit
          would leave him.

          2 Chron 20 - After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the
          Meunites came to wage war against Jehoshaphat. Some people came and
          told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from
          the other side of the Dead Sea. It is already in Hazezon Tamar ” (that
          is, En Gedi). Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the LORD,
          and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah. The people of Judah came
          together to seek help from the LORD; indeed, they came from every town
          in Judah to seek him. Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of
          Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the LORD in the front of the new
          courtyard and said: “LORD, the God of our ancestors, are you not the
          God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations.
          Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you. Our
          God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your
          people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your
          friend? They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for
          your Name, saying, ‘If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of
          judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before
          this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our
          distress, and you will hear us and save us.’ “But now here are men
          from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow
          Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from
          them and did not destroy them. See how they are repaying us by coming
          to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance. Our
          God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast
          army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are
          on you. ” All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and
          little ones, stood there before the LORD. Then the Spirit of the LORD
          came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of
          Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he
          stood in the assembly. He said: “Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who
          live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the LORD says to you: ‘Do
          not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle
          is not yours, but God’s. Tomorrow march down against them. They will
          be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end
          of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel. You will not have to fight this
          battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the
          LORD will give you, Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be
          discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the LORD will be with
          you.’” Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the
          people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the LORD.
          Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and
          praised the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice. Early in
          the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out,
          Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and people of
          Jerusalem! Have faith in the LORD your God and you will be upheld;
          have faith in his prophets and you will be successful. ” After
          consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the LORD
          and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at
          the head of the army, saying: “Give thanks to the LORD, for his love
          endures forever.” As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set
          ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were
          invading Judah, and they were defeated. The Ammonites and Moabites
          rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate
          them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped
          to destroy one another. When the men of Judah came to the place that
          overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only
          dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped. So Jehoshaphat
          and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them
          a great amount of equipment and clothing and also articles of
          value—more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that
          it took three days to collect it. On the fourth day they assembled in
          the Valley of Berakah, where they praised the LORD. This is why it is
          called the Valley of Berakah to this day. Then, led by Jehoshaphat,
          all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for
          the LORD had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies. They
          entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the LORD with harps and
          lyres and trumpets. The fear of God came on all the surrounding
          kingdoms when they heard how the LORD had fought against the enemies
          of Israel. And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God
          had given him rest on every side. The End of Jehoshaphat’s Reign
          20:31–21:1pp — 1Ki 22:41-50 So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was
          thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in
          Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of
          Shilhi. He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from
          them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. The high places,
          however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their
          hearts on the God of their ancestors. The other events of
          Jehoshaphat’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals
          of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of
          Israel. Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah
          king of Israel, whose ways were wicked. He agreed with him to
          construct a fleet of trading ships. After these were built at Ezion
          Geber, Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against
          Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah,
          the LORD will destroy what you have made.” The ships were wrecked and
          were not able to set sail to trade.

        <p>BLOOD OF JESUS</p>
        <p>
          Rev 12:11 - They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by
          the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as
          to shrink from death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb 9:19-22 - When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to
          all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water,
          scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all
          the people. He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has
          commanded you to keep.” In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood
          both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. In fact,
          the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and
          without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. 26 Otherwise
          Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the
          world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages
          to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.

          God’s wrath through him!

          we may serve the living God!

        <p>
          Heb 10:19-22 (presence of God) - Therefore, brothers and sisters,
          since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of
          Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that
          is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
          let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full
          assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us
          from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
