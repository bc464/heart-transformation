        He who overcomes (is victorious), I will grant him to sit beside Me on
        My throne, as I Myself overcame (was victorious) and sat down beside My

        <p>
          Eph 6:10-13 * - Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty
          power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand
          against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and
          blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the
          powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in
          the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that
          when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and
          after you have done everything, to stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gal. 5:16-22 So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify
          the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to
          the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in
          conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want.
          But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. The acts
          of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;
          idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,
          selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies,
          and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like
          this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit
          is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
          gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb 11:6 - And without faith it is impossible to please God, because
          anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he
          rewards those who earnestly seek him.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 John 2:15-17 - Do not love the world or anything in the world. If
          anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For
          everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
          and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.
          The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God
          lives forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Cor 3:5-15 - What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only
          servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to
          each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has
          been making it grow. So neither the one who plants nor the one who
          waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. The one who
          plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be
          rewarded according to their own labor. For we are co-workers in God’s
          service; you are God’s field, God’s building. By the grace God has
          given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is
          building on it. But each one should build with care. For no one can
          lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus
          Christ. If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly
          stones, wood, hay or straw, their work will be shown for what it is,
          because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire,
          and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work. If what has
          been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. If it is
          burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even
          though only as one escaping through the flames.

          Dan. 10:12-13 - Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since
          the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to
          humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have
          come in response to them. But the prince of the Persian kingdom
          resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes,
          came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt 12:29 - Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and
          carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then
          he can plunder his house.

          2 Cor 4:4 - The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers,
          so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the
          glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          John 16:8-10 - When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the
          wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: about sin, because
          people do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going
          to the Father, where you can see me no longer;

          Isa. 25:6-10 - On this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare a feast
          of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine— the best of
          meats and the finest of wines. On this mountain he will destroy the
          shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations; he
          will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the
          tears from all faces; he will remove his people’s disgrace from all
          the earth. The LORD has spoken. In that day they will say, “Surely
          this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the LORD,
          we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.” The
          hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain; but Moab will be trampled
          in their land as straw is trampled down in the manure.

        <p>
          Ezek. 28:14-19 - You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I
          ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the
          fiery stones. You were blameless in your ways from the day you were
          created till wickedness was found in you. Through your widespread
          trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in
          disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub,
          from among the fiery stones. Your heart became proud on account of
          your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor.
          So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.
          By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your
          sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you,
          and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were
          watching. All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have
          come to a horrible end and will be no more. ’”
        </p>
        <p>
          Isa 14:11-15 - All your pomp has been brought down to the grave, along
          with the noise of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you and
          worms cover you. How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of
          the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low
          the nations! You said in your heart, “I will ascend to the heavens; I
          will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on
          the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will
          ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most
          High.” But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the
          depths of the pit.

        <p>
          Job 1:6-12 - One day the angels came to present themselves before the
          LORD, and Satan also came with them. The LORD said to Satan, “Where
          have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout
          the earth, going back and forth on it.” Then the LORD said to Satan,
          “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like
          him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”
          “Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. “Have you not put a
          hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have
          blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread
          throughout the land. But now stretch out your hand and strike
          everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.” The
          LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your
          power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Job 2:1-10 - On another day the angels came to present themselves
          before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself
          before him. And the LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”
          Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going
          back and forth on it.” Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you
          considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is
          blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he
          still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to
          ruin him without any reason.” “Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man
          will give all he has for his own life. But now stretch out your hand
          and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your
          face.” The LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands;
          but you must spare his life.” So Satan went out from the presence of
          the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his
          feet to the crown of his head. Then Job took a piece of broken pottery
          and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes. His wife said
          to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”
          He replied, “You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept
          good from God, and not trouble?” In all this, Job did not sin in what
          he said.

          Job 3:25 - What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened
          to me.

        <p>
          Matt 4:1-11 - Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to
          be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he
          was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of
          God, tell these stones to become bread.” Jesus answered, “It is
          written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that
          comes from the mouth of God.’” Then the devil took him to the holy
          city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are
          the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:
          “‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up
          in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a
          stone.’” Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord
          your God to the test.’” Again, the devil took him to a very high
          mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their
          splendor. “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down
          and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is
          written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’” Then the
          devil left him, and angels came and attended him.
        </p>
        <p>
          James 1:13-15 - When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.”
          For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each
          person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire
          and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin;
          and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.

        <p>
          Rev. 20:2-3, 7-10- He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is
          the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. He threw him
          into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from
          deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended.
          After that, he must be set free for a short time.Blessed and holy are
          those who share in the first resurrection. The Judgment of Satan When
          the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison
          and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the
          earth —Gog and Magog —and to gather them for battle. In number they
          are like the sand on the seashore. They marched across the breadth of
          the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves.
          But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil, who
          deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the
          beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented
          day and night for ever and ever.

        <p>
          John 8:44 - You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to
          carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning,
          not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies,
          he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of
          lies.

          John 10:10 - The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I

        <p>CLAIMING CHRIST'S POWER</p>
        <p>Phil. 4:13 - I can do all this through him who gives me strength.</p>
        <p>
          Col 1:10-24 - so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and
          please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in
          the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to
          his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience,
          and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share
          in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light. For he
          has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the
          kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the
          forgiveness of sins. The Supremacy of the Son of God The Son is the
          image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For in
          him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible
          and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all
          things have been created through him and for him. He is before all
          things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the
          body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the
          dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. For God was
          pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to
          reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in
          heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. Once you
          were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your
          evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body
          through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and
          free from accusation — if you continue in your faith, established and
          firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is
          the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every
          creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
          Paul’s Labor for the Church Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for
          you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to
          Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph 1:18-23 - I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in
          order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the
          riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, and his
          incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as
          the mighty strength he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and
          seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all
          rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is
          invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. And
          God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over
          everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who
          fills everything in every way.

          1 Cor 10:13 - No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to
          mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond
          what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a
          way out so that you can endure it.

        <p>
          Rom 5:8-10 - But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While
          we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been
          justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s
          wrath through him! For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were
          reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having
          been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!
        </p>
        <p>
          Rom. 8:19-25 - For the creation waits in eager expectation for the
          children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to
          frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who
          subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from
          its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the
          children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as
          in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. Not only so,
          but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan
          inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the
          redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. But hope
          that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?
          But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.

          Ps 19:1-8 - The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim
          the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night
          after night they reveal knowledge. They have no speech, they use no
          words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all
          the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens God
          has pitched a tent for the sun. It is like a bridegroom coming out of
          his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. It rises at
          one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is
          deprived of its warmth. The law of the LORD is perfect, refreshing the
          soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the
          simple. The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart.
          The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.

          2 Peter 1:3-4 - His divine power has given us everything we need for a
          godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory
          and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and
          precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the

          word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the
          right hand of the Majesty in heaven."

          Acts 19:11-19 - God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that
          even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the
          sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.
          Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the
          name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would
          say, “In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to
          come out.” Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing
          this. One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I
          know about, but who are you?” Then the man who had the evil spirit
          jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating
          that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. When this became
          known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized
          with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. Many
          of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had
          done. A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls
          together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of
          the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.

      <h4>* Scripture on Believers' Baptism</h4>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Rom 6 - What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace
          may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can
          we live in it any longer? Or don’t you know that all of us who were
          baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were
          therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that,
          just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
          Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with
          him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in
          a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified
          with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that
          we should no longer be slaves to sin — because anyone who has died has
          been set free from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we
          will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from
          the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.
          The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives,
          he lives to God. In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but
          alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your
          mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer any part
          of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer
          yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life;
          and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of
          righteousness. For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are
          not under the law, but under grace. Slaves to Righteousness What then?
          Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no
          means! Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as
          obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey —whether you are
          slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to
          righteousness? But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves
          to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching
          that has now claimed your allegiance. You have been set free from sin
          and have become slaves to righteousness. I am using an example from
          everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to
          offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing
          wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading
          to holiness. When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the
          control of righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that time from
          the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! But
          now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of
          God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal
          life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal
          life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

          Rom 7:1 - Do you not know, brothers and sisters —for I am speaking to

          Rom 7:4 - So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law

          1 John 5:4-12 - for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is
          the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. Who is it
          that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the
          Son of God. This is the one who came by water and blood —Jesus Christ.
          He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the
          Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are
          three that testify: the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three
          are in agreement. We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is
          greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about
          his Son. Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony.
          Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because
          they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. And
          this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is
          in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the
          Son of God does not have life.

          off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him
          in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith
          in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. When you were
          dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made
          you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the
          charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned
          us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed
          the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them,
          triumphing over them by the cross. - take note verse 12 'through your

          Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip
          baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the
          Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again,
          but went on his way rejoicing. Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and

          to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. Let our lord
          command his servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre.
          He will play when the evil spirit from God comes on you, and you will
          feel better.” So Saul said to his attendants, “Find someone who plays
          well and bring him to me.” One of the servants answered, “I have seen
          a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a
          brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And
          the LORD is with him.” Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said,
          “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep. ” So Jesse took a
          donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent
          them with his son David to Saul. David came to Saul and entered his
          service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his
          armor-bearers. Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Allow David to
          remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.” Whenever the spirit
          from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then
          relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit
          would leave him.

          2 Chron 20 - After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the
          Meunites came to wage war against Jehoshaphat. Some people came and
          told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from
          the other side of the Dead Sea. It is already in Hazezon Tamar ” (that
          is, En Gedi). Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the LORD,
          and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah. The people of Judah came
          together to seek help from the LORD; indeed, they came from every town
          in Judah to seek him. Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of
          Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the LORD in the front of the new
          courtyard and said: “LORD, the God of our ancestors, are you not the
          God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations.
          Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you. Our
          God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your
          people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your
          friend? They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for
          your Name, saying, ‘If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of
          judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before
          this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our
          distress, and you will hear us and save us.’ “But now here are men
          from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow
          Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from
          them and did not destroy them. See how they are repaying us by coming
          to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance. Our
          God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast
          army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are
          on you. ” All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and
          little ones, stood there before the LORD. Then the Spirit of the LORD
          came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of
          Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he
          stood in the assembly. He said: “Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who
          live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the LORD says to you: ‘Do
          not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle
          is not yours, but God’s. Tomorrow march down against them. They will
          be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end
          of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel. You will not have to fight this
          battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the
          LORD will give you, Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be
          discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the LORD will be with
          you.’” Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the
          people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the LORD.
          Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and
          praised the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice. Early in
          the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out,
          Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and people of
          Jerusalem! Have faith in the LORD your God and you will be upheld;
          have faith in his prophets and you will be successful. ” After
          consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the LORD
          and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at
          the head of the army, saying: “Give thanks to the LORD, for his love
          endures forever.” As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set
          ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were
          invading Judah, and they were defeated. The Ammonites and Moabites
          rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate
          them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped
          to destroy one another. When the men of Judah came to the place that
          overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only
          dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped. So Jehoshaphat
          and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them
          a great amount of equipment and clothing and also articles of
          value—more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that
          it took three days to collect it. On the fourth day they assembled in
          the Valley of Berakah, where they praised the LORD. This is why it is
          called the Valley of Berakah to this day. Then, led by Jehoshaphat,
          all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for
          the LORD had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies. They
          entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the LORD with harps and
          lyres and trumpets. The fear of God came on all the surrounding
          kingdoms when they heard how the LORD had fought against the enemies
          of Israel. And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God
          had given him rest on every side. The End of Jehoshaphat’s Reign
          20:31–21:1pp — 1Ki 22:41-50 So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was
          thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in
          Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of
          Shilhi. He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from
          them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. The high places,
          however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their
          hearts on the God of their ancestors. The other events of
          Jehoshaphat’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals
          of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of
          Israel. Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah
          king of Israel, whose ways were wicked. He agreed with him to
          construct a fleet of trading ships. After these were built at Ezion
          Geber, Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against
          Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah,
          the LORD will destroy what you have made.” The ships were wrecked and
          were not able to set sail to trade.

          Rev 12:11 - They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by

          Heb 9:19-22 - When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to
          all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water,
          scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all
          the people. He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has
          commanded you to keep.” In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood
          both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. In fact,
          the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and
          without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. 26 Otherwise
          Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the
          world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages
          to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.

          is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
          let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full

              Matt 4:1-11 - Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
              to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty
              nights, he was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, “If you
              are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” Jesus
              answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but
              on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” Then the devil
              took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point
              of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw
              yourself down. For it is written: “‘He will command his angels
              concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that
              you will not strike your foot against a stone.’” Jesus answered
              him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the
              test.’” Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and
              showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. “All
              this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship
              me.” Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written:
              ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’” Then the devil
              left him, and angels came and attended him.

              Matt 8:8-17 - The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to
              have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant
              will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with
              soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that
              one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he
              does it.” When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those
              following him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in
              Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come
              from the east and the west, and will take their places at the
              feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But
              the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the
              darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Then
              Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you
              believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment.
              Jesus Heals Many 8:14-16pp — Mk 1:29-34; Lk 4:38-41 When Jesus
              came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed
              with a fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she
              got up and began to wait on him. When evening came, many who were
              demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits
              with a word and healed all the sick. This was to fulfill what was
              spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and
              bore our diseases.”

            <h4>FASTING</h4>
            <p>
              Isa. 58 - Shout it aloud, do not hold back. Raise your voice like
              a trumpet. Declare to my people their rebellion and to the
              descendants of Jacob their sins. For day after day they seek me
              out; they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation
              that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its
              God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager for God to come
              near them. ‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and you have not seen
              it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?’ “Yet
              on the day of your fasting, you do as you please and exploit all
              your workers. Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife, and in
              striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do
              today and expect your voice to be heard on high. Is this the kind
              of fast I have chosen, only a day for people to humble themselves?
              Is it only for bowing one’s head like a reed and for lying in
              sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a day
              acceptable to the LORD? “Is not this the kind of fasting I have
              chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of
              the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? Is it
              not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor
              wanderer with shelter — when you see the naked, to clothe them,
              and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood? Then your
              light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will
              quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and
              the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. Then you will call,
              and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say:
              Here am I. “If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the
              pointing finger and malicious talk, and if you spend yourselves in
              behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then
              your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become
              like the noonday. The LORD will guide you always; he will satisfy
              your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame.
              You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters
              never fail. Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will
              raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of
              Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings. “If you keep

              Luke 4:1-14 - Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and
              was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, where for forty days he
              was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at
              the end of them he was hungry. The devil said to him, “If you are
              the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.” Jesus answered,
              “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’” The devil
              led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the
              kingdoms of the world. And he said to him, “I will give you all
              their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can
              give it to anyone I want to. If you worship me, it will all be
              yours.” Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God
              and serve him only.’” The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him
              stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of
              God,” he said, “throw yourself down from here. For it is written:
              “‘He will command his angels concerning you to guard you
              carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will
              not strike your foot against a stone.’” Jesus answered, “It is
              said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’” When the devil
              had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune
              time. Jesus Rejected at Nazareth Jesus returned to Galilee in the
              power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole
              countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone
              praised him.

              are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in
              full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
              so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but
              only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what
              is done in secret, will reward you.

            <p>
              John 17 - After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and
              prayed: “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your
              Son may glorify you. For you granted him authority over all people
              that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.
              Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God,
              and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on
              earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father,
              glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before
              the world began. Jesus Prays for His Disciples “I have revealed
              you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours;
              you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word. Now they know
              that everything you have given me comes from you. For I gave them
              the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with
              certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent
              me. I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those
              you have given me, for they are yours. All I have is yours, and
              all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. I
              will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the
              world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the
              power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one
              as we are one. While I was with them, I protected them and kept
              them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the
              one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled. “I
              am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in
              the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within
              them. I have given them your word and the world has hated them,
              for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My
              prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you
              protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as
              I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As
              you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For
              them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.
              Jesus Prays for All Believers “My prayer is not for them alone. I
              pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,
              that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I
              am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe
              that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave
              me, that they may be one as we are one — I in them and you in
              me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world
              will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have
              loved me. “Father, I want those you have given me to be with me
              where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me
              because you loved me before the creation of the world. “Righteous
              Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they
              know that you have sent me. I have made you known to them, and
              will continue to make you known in order that the love you have
              for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.”

              1 Cor 3:1-9 - Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as
              people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly
              —mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you
              were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. You
              are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling
              among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere
              humans? For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow
              Apollos,” are you not mere human beings? What, after all, is
              Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to
              believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the
              seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. So
              neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but
              only God, who makes things grow. The one who plants and the one
              who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded
              according to their own labor. For we are co-workers in God’s
              service; you are God’s field, God’s building.

          have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God,
          did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own
          advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature
          of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in
          appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death
          — even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest
          place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name
          of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the
          earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the

        <p>LOVE</p>
        <p>
          1 John 4 - Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the
          spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets
          have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit
          of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in
          the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge
          Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you
          have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. You, dear
          children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is
          in you is greater than the one who is in the world. They are from the
          world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the
          world listens to them. We are from God, and whoever knows God listens
          to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how
          we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood. God’s
          Love and Ours Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes
          from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
          Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is
          how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into
          the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we
          loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning
          sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also
          ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; but if we love
          one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. This
          is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of
          his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his
          Son to be the Savior of the world. If anyone acknowledges that Jesus
          is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. And so we know
          and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in
          love lives in God, and God in them. This is how love is made complete
          among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In
          this world we are like Jesus. There is no fear in love. But perfect
          love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one
          who fears is not made perfect in love. We love because he first loved
          us. Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a
          liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they
          have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. And he has given
          us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and
          sister.

        <p>
          1 Cor 13 - If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not
          have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have
          the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
          and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I
          am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body
          to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
          Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it
          is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it
          is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not
          delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects,
          always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But
          where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues,
          they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For
          we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes,
          what is in part disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child,
          I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man,
          I put the ways of childhood behind me. For now we see only a
          reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know
          in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. And now
          these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is
          love.

        <p>BELIEVER'S BAPTISM</p>
        <p>
          Rom. 6 - What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace
          may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can
          we live in it any longer? Or don’t you know that all of us who were
          baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were
          therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that,
          just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
          Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with
          him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in
          a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified
          with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that
          we should no longer be slaves to sin — because anyone who has died has
          been set free from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we
          will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from
          the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.
          The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives,
          he lives to God. In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but
          alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your
          mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer any part
          of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer
          yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life;
          and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of
          righteousness. For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are
          not under the law, but under grace. Slaves to Righteousness What then?
          Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no
          means! Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as
          obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey —whether you are
          slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to
          righteousness? But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves
          to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching
          that has now claimed your allegiance. You have been set free from sin
          and have become slaves to righteousness. I am using an example from
          everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to
          offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing
          wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading
          to holiness. When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the
          control of righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that time from
          the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! But
          now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of
          God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal
          life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal
          life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

          Col. 2:11-15 - In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision
          not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was
          put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with
          him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your
          faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. When you
          were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God
          made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having
          canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us
          and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. And
          having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle
          of them, triumphing over them by the cross.

        <p>ARMOUR OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          Eph. 6:10-20 - Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
          Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against
          the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
          but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of
          this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the
          heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when
          the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after
          you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of
          truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness
          in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from
          the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of
          faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the
          evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit,
          which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with
          all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and
          always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. Pray also for me,
          that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly
          make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in
          chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.

          Satan is the accuser of my soul(Rev 12:10 - Then I heard a loud voice
          in heaven say: “Now have come the salvation and the power and the
          kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser
          of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and
          night, has been hurled down.) He is the father of lies.(John 8:44 -
          You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your
          father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to
          the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his
          native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.). He will
          attack me in the area of self worth and unfaithfulness to God. He
          twists motives and causes to feel proud. I must realize who is giving
          me those thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          He will break me down wherever he can. (Matt 3:17 - And a voice from
          heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well
          pleased.”)
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus has already defeated him! Jesus never accuses or condemns. He
          only encourages and builds up. (Rom 8:1 - Therefore, there is now no
          condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,). Satan is constantly
          trying to separate me from the Lord.(Rom 8:31-38 - What, then, shall
          we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be
          against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us
          all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all
          things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
          It is God who justifies. Who then is the one who condemns? No one.
          Christ Jesus who died —more than that, who was raised to life —is at
          the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall
          separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or
          persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is
          written: “For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered
          as sheep to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than
          conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither
          death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the
          future, nor any powers,). We are fighting a defeated foe!
        </p>
        <p>
          Guilt is God-given, it is our conscience telling us we have done wrong
          - violated God's standard. God wants me to respond to guilt by coming
          to Jesus in repentance and accept his forgiveness and then forgive
          myself. "False guilt comes through the judgements and suggestions of
          men and when we fall short of our own self-established standards, or
          feelings of failure - it is generally a general feeling which is not
          related to the Word of God." The guilt of conviction is when we fall
          short of God's eternal standard. (It is specific).
        </p>
        <p>
          We must learn to distinguish because Satan would bind me with "false
          guilt" and hold me in bondage I would simply need to rehect it in
          Jesus' Name, e.g. "God wouldn't forgive me for that sin, or once
          asking God for forgiveness that "God will remember that sin". Ps.
          103:12 "God removes my sin as far as the East is from the West and He
          totally remembers them no more."
        </p>
        <p>
          Satan's first area of attack is the Word of God(Gen 3:1 - Now the
          serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had
          made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat
          from any tree in the garden’? ”), he will make me question it, also my
          salvation, my motives, or whatever weakness. Praise God we can counter
          attack with the Word. Jesus quoted the Word and Satan fled. (Matt.
          4:1-11 - Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be
          tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he
          was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of
          God, tell these stones to become bread.” Jesus answered, “It is
          written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that
          comes from the mouth of God.’” Then the devil took him to the holy
          city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are
          the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:
          “‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up
          in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a
          stone.’” Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord
          your God to the test.’” Again, the devil took him to a very high
          mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their
          splendor. “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down
          and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is
          written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’” Then the
          devil left him, and angels came and attended him.)

        Gal. 5:17-18 - For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and
        the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each
        other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. But if you are led

        1 Pet. 1:3-9 - Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!
        In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through
        the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance
        that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven
        for you, who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming
        of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. In all
        this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had
        to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that the
        proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which
        perishes even though refined by fire —may result in praise, glory and
        honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. Though you have not seen him, you
        love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and
        are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving
        the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

        Phil. 2:12-13 - Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always

        works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.

        Heb 4:12 - For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any

        the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your

        of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven. As was the
        earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly
        man, so also are those who are of heaven. And just as we have borne the

          Matt 15:2-26, 28 - “Why do your disciples break the tradition of the
          elders? They don’t wash their hands before they eat!” Jesus replied,
          “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your
          tradition? For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone
          who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’ But you say
          that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their
          father or mother is ‘devoted to God,’ they are not to ‘honor their
          father or mother’ with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the
          sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he
          prophesied about you: “‘These people honor me with their lips, but
          their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings
          are merely human rules. ’ ” Jesus called the crowd to him and said,
          “Listen and understand. What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile
          them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”
          Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the
          Pharisees were offended when they heard this?” He replied, “Every
          plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the
          roots. Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind,
          both will fall into a pit.” Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.”
          “Are you still so dull?” Jesus asked them. “Don’t you see that
          whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the
          body? But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the
          heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil
          thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony,
          slander. These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed
          hands does not defile them.” Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the
          region of Tyre and Sidon. A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to
          him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is
          demon-possessed and suffering terribly.” Jesus did not answer a word.
          So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she
          keeps crying out after us.” He answered, “I was sent only to the lost
          sheep of Israel.” The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help
          me!” she said. He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s
          bread and toss it to the dogs.” 28 Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you
          have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was
          healed at that moment.

          Luke 8:26-40 - They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is
          across the lake from Galilee. When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by
          a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not
          worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. When he
          saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of
          his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?
          I beg you, don’t torture me!” For Jesus had commanded the impure
          spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and
          though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had
          broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary
          places. Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he replied,
          because many demons had gone into him. And they begged Jesus
          repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. A large herd of
          pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let
          them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. When the demons
          came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down
          the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. When those tending the
          pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town
          and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.
          When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had
          gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and
          they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people how the
          demon-possessed man had been cured. Then all the people of the region
          of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome
          with fear. So he got into the boat and left. The man from whom the
          demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away,
          saying, “Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the
          man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.
          Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all
          expecting him.

          Heb 2:6-18 - But there is a place where someone has testified: “What
          is mankind that you are mindful of them, a son of man that you care
          for him? You made them a little lower than the angels; you crowned
          them with glory and honor and put everything under their feet.”, In
          putting everything under them, God left nothing that is not subject to
          them. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them. But we
          do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while,
          now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by
          the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. In bringing many
          sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and
          through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their
          salvation perfect through what he suffered. Both the one who makes
          people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So
          Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters. He says, “I
          will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I
          will sing your praises.” And again, “I will put my trust in him.” And
          again he says, “Here am I, and the children God has given me.” Since
          the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so
          that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power
          of death—that is, the devil — and free those who all their lives were
          held in slavery by their fear of death. For surely it is not angels he
          helps, but Abraham’s descendants. For this reason he had to be made
          like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a
          merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might
          make atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself suffered
          when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.

          enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. For
          he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that
          “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not
          include God himself, who put everything under Christ. When he has done
          this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put
          everything under him, so that God may be all in all.

              peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the
              Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites,
              Egyptians and Amorites. They have taken some of their daughters as

              race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials
              have led the way in this unfaithfulness.” When I heard this, I

              the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.
              Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement,
              with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands
              spread out to the LORD my God and prayed: “I am too ashamed and
              disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are
              higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens.
              From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been
              great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have
              been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and
              humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today. “But
              now, for a brief moment, the LORD our God has been gracious in
              leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary,
              and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our
              bondage. Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our
              bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of
              Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God
              and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in
              Judah and Jerusalem. “But now, our God, what can we say after
              this? For we have forsaken the commands you gave through your
              servants the prophets when you said: ‘The land you are entering to
              possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By
              their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity
              from one end to the other. Therefore, do not give your daughters
              in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons.
              Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you
              may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to
              your children as an everlasting inheritance.’ “What has happened
              to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet,
              our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have
              given us a remnant like this. Shall we then break your commands
              again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable
              practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us,
              leaving us no remnant or survivor? LORD, the God of Israel, you
              are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are
              before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can
              stand in your presence. ”

            <i>Dealing with generational sin </i>(Prayer from John and Paula
            Sandford <i>"Transformation of the Inner Man")</i>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In prayer, in the authority of the name of Jesus, place the cross
              of Jesus between the person and his mother and father, their
              mothers and fathers, and each specific generation up to the fourth
              generation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Praise and thank God for all that has come to us through our
              forefathers - for all the good we inherit daily and that even the
              good be filtered through the cross of Jesus.
            </li>
            <li>
              Call for the blood of Jesus to flow back through the family
              bloodlines throughout their history, by forgiveness washing away
              the ground of Satan's attack.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ask in repentance for forgiveness of all sins, wherever possible.
              Whatever patterns you see ask Jesus to destroy and transform on
              His cross.<br />
              It is through unforgiven sin and consequent descending patterns
              that Satan perpetuates his destructions on families. Wherever sin
              allowed access, Satan enters to prey upon physical weaknesses, to
              exploit sinful tendencies, to cause addictions, proneness to
              accidents to become tragedies, bad examples to become traps,
              necessities to reap to escalate to whirlwinds of destruction.
              <i>"The thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy."</i>(John
              10:10)
            </li>
            <li>
              After praying for destructive patterns to be destroyed, then
              rebuke the powers of darkness and command them to leave in Jesus
              name. Ask Father God to send angels to encamp about every member
              of the family, to protect and to bring each one out of darkness
              into His light in the name of Jesus.

              the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,
              governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jozadak, the
              high priest, and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people.
              They came and began to work on the house of the LORD Almighty,
