      <h2>GOD'S LOVE AND HOW PRECIOUS I AM IN HIS SIGHT</h2>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          One of our greatest sins is that we do not accept God's love and
          accept ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>"We love Him because He first loved us" 1 John 4:19</p>
        <p>
          God has called us FIRST of all to be worshippers of the living God.
          This is our FIRST calling and ministry. "To love the Lord your God
          with your whole heart, soul, and mind (intellect) and all that is
          within you" and the second is like it: "You shall love your neighbour
          as you yourself. These two commandments sum up and upon them depend
          all the Law and the prohets." (Matt. 22:37-40)"
        </p>

        <p>
          That says it all! But how far we fall short of that! Marriages and
          relationships are not walking in the fullness of what God has for us,
          because of our sinfulness and brokenness. God through His grace and
          love in His time comes to recreate us to reflect His glory and that we
          can walk in the 'abundant life' that He talks about in His Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gal. 2:20 - I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live,
          but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by
          faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
        </p>
        <p>Matt. 5:8 - Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.</p>
        <p>
          Jesus has come to reflect the Father Heart of God. When we see Jesus,
          we see the Father. So that He can identify with us and us with Him.
          John 1:18 - No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is
          himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made
          him known.

          Isa 9:6-7 - For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the
          government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful
          Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the
          greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will
          reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and
          upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and
          forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish

          Isa 49:15 - Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no
          compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will
          not forget you!
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 22:10 - From birth I was cast on you; from my mother’s womb you
          have been my God.

          John 17:23 - I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to
          complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have
          loved them even as you have loved me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb. 2:17-18 - For this reason he had to be made like them, fully
          human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and
          faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make
          atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself suffered when
          he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.

        <p>
          Rom. 5:5 - And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has
          been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been
          given to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 10:14 - But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted; you
          consider their grief and take it in hand. The victims commit
          themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.

          Isa. 52:14-15 - Just as there were many who were appalled at him— his
          appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and his
          form marred beyond human likeness — so he will sprinkle many nations,
          and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were
          not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will
          understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isa 53 - ​ Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the
          LORD been revealed? He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and
          like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract
          us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was
          despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar
          with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised,
          and we held him in low esteem. Surely he took up our pain and bore our
          suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and
          afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed
          for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him,
          and by his wounds we are healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
          each of us has turned to our own way; and the LORD has laid on him the
          iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not
          open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
          sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. By
          oppression and judgment he was taken away. Yet who of his generation
          protested? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the
          transgression of my people he was punished. He was assigned a grave
          with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no
          violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the LORD’s will
          to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his
          life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his
          days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. After he has
          suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his
          knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear
          their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,
          and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out
          his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he
          bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

          Song of Solomon 4:6-16 - Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, I
          will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of incense. You are
          altogether beautiful, my darling; there is no flaw in you. Come with
          me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the
          crest of Amana, from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon, from the
          lions’ dens and the mountain haunts of leopards. You have stolen my
          heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with one glance
          of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace. How delightful is your
          love, my sister, my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than
          wine, and the fragrance of your perfume more than any spice! Your lips
          drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride; milk and honey are under
          your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of
          Lebanon. You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride; you are a
          spring enclosed, a sealed fountain. Your plants are an orchard of
          pomegranates with choice fruits, with henna and nard, nard and
          saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree, with
          myrrh and aloes and all the finest spices. You are a garden fountain,
          a well of flowing water streaming down from Lebanon. She Awake, north
          wind, and come, south wind! Blow on my garden, that its fragrance may
          spread everywhere. Let my beloved come into his garden and taste its
          choice fruits.

          Zeph. 3:16-17 - On that day they will say to Jerusalem, “Do not fear,
          Zion; do not let your hands hang limp. The LORD your God is with you,
          the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in
          his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with
          singing.”

          Isa. 45:9-11 - Woe to those who quarrel with their Maker, those who
          are nothing but potsherds among the potsherds on the ground. Does the
          clay say to the potter, ‘What are you making?’ Does your work say,
          ‘The potter has no hands’? Woe to the one who says to a father, ‘What
          have you begotten?’ or to a mother, ‘What have you brought to birth?’
          “This is what the LORD says— the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker:
          Concerning things to come, do you question me about my children, or
          give me orders about the work of my hands?
        </p>
        <p>
          Psa. 139 - You have searched me, LORD, and you know me. You know when
          I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern
          my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.
          Before a word is on my tongue you, LORD, know it completely. You hem
          me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me. Such knowledge
          is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. Where can I go
          from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to
          the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are
          there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side
          of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will
          hold me fast. If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me and the
          light become night around me,” even the darkness will not be dark to
          you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to
          you. For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my
          mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully
          made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was
          not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was
          woven together in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed
          body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before
          one of them came to be. How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How
          vast is the sum of them! Were I to count them, they would outnumber
          the grains of sand — when I awake, I am still with you. If only you,
          God, would slay the wicked! Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty!
          They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.
          Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD, and abhor those who are in
          rebellion against you? I have nothing but hatred for them; I count
          them my enemies. Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know
          my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead
          me in the way everlasting.

          Rom. 9:23-24 - What if he did this to make the riches of his glory
          known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for
          glory — even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also
          from the Gentiles?

          1 John 3:1-3 - See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that
          we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The
          reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Dear
          friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet
          been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be
          like him, for we shall see him as he is. All who have this hope in him
          purify themselves, just as he is pure.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Tim 2:11-13 - Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we
          will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him. If
          we disown him, he will also disown us; if we are faithless, he remains
          faithful, for he cannot disown himself.

          1 Cor. 6:19-20 - Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the
          Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are
          not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with
          your bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph. 3:16-21 - I pray that out of his glorious riches he may
          strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so
          that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that
          you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together
          with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high
          and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses
          knowledge —that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness
          of God. Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask
          or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him
          be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations,
          for ever and ever! Amen.

          Ps 91 - Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in
          the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, “He is my refuge
          and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.” Surely he will save you
          from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover
          you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his
          faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. You will not fear the
          terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence
          that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. A
          thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but
          it will not come near you. You will only observe with your eyes and
          see the punishment of the wicked. If you say, “The LORD is my refuge,”
          and you make the Most High your dwelling, no harm will overtake you,
          no disaster will come near your tent. For he will command his angels
          concerning you to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in
          their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
          You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great
          lion and the serpent. “Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will
          rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. He will
          call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I
          will deliver him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him and
          show him my salvation. ”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 18 - (For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD.
          He sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him
          from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:)
          I love you, LORD, my strength. The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my
          deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the
          horn of my salvation, my stronghold. I called to the LORD, who is
          worthy of praise, and I have been saved from my enemies. The cords of
          death entangled me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me. The
          cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted
          me. In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried to my God for help.
          From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his
          ears. The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the
          mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry. Smoke rose from
          his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed
          out of it. He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under
          his feet. He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of
          the wind. He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him— the
          dark rain clouds of the sky. Out of the brightness of his presence
          clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning. The LORD
          thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. He shot
          his arrows and scattered the enemy, with great bolts of lightning he
          routed them. The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations
          of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, LORD, at the blast of breath
          from your nostrils. He reached down from on high and took hold of me;
          he drew me out of deep waters. He rescued me from my powerful enemy,
          from my foes, who were too strong for me. They confronted me in the
          day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support. He brought me out
          into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me. The
          LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the
          cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me. For I have kept the ways of
          the LORD; I am not guilty of turning from my God. All his laws are
          before me; I have not turned away from his decrees. I have been
          blameless before him and have kept myself from sin. The LORD has
          rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness
          of my hands in his sight. To the faithful you show yourself faithful,
          to the blameless you show yourself blameless, to the pure you show
          yourself pure, but to the devious you show yourself shrewd. You save
          the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty. You, LORD, keep
          my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light. With your help I
          can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall. As for
          God, his way is perfect: The LORD’s word is flawless; he shields all
          who take refuge in him. For who is God besides the LORD? And who is
          the Rock except our God? It is God who arms me with strength and keeps
          my way secure. He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he causes me
          to stand on the heights. He trains my hands for battle; my arms can
          bend a bow of bronze. You make your saving help my shield, and your
          right hand sustains me; your help has made me great. You provide a
          broad path for my feet, so that my ankles do not give way. I pursued
          my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were
          destroyed. I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell
          beneath my feet. You armed me with strength for battle; you humbled my
          adversaries before me. You made my enemies turn their backs in flight,
          and I destroyed my foes. They cried for help, but there was no one to
          save them — to the LORD, but he did not answer. I beat them as fine as
          windblown dust; I trampled them like mud in the streets. You have
          delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head
          of nations. People I did not know now serve me, foreigners cower
          before me; as soon as they hear of me, they obey me. They all lose
          heart; they come trembling from their strongholds. The LORD lives!
          Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior! He is the God who
          avenges me, who subdues nations under me, who saves me from my
          enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from a violent man you rescued
          me. Therefore I will praise you, LORD, among the nations; I will sing
          the praises of your name. He gives his king great victories; he shows
          unfailing love to his anointed, to David and to his descendants
          forever.

          Eph 1: whole chapter(put your name in it) - Paul, an apostle of Christ
          Jesus by the will of God, To God’s holy people in Ephesus, the
          faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace and peace to you from God our Father
          and the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise for Spiritual Blessings in Christ
          Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has
          blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in
          Christ. For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be
          holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us for
          adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his
          pleasure and will— to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has
          freely given us in the One he loves. In him we have redemption through
          his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of
          God’s grace that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding,
          he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good
          pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the
          times reach their fulfillment —to bring unity to all things in heaven
          and on earth under Christ. In him we were also chosen, having been
          predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in
          conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were
          the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his
          glory. And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message
          of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were
          marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit
          guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are
          God’s possession—to the praise of his glory. Thanksgiving and Prayer
          For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus
          and your love for all God’s people, I have not stopped giving thanks
          for you, remembering you in my prayers. I keep asking that the God of
          our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of
          wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. I pray that
          the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know
          the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious
          inheritance in his holy people, and his incomparably great power for
          us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength he
          exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his
          right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority,
          power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the
          present age but also in the one to come. And God placed all things
          under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the
          church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in
          every way.
