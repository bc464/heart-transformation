      <h1>Discerning the will of God & the bride of Christ in Proverbs 31</h1>
      <p>
        "The [Holy] Spirit and the bride (the church, the true Christians) sat,
        Come! And let him who is listening say, Come! And let everyone who is
        thirsty [who is painfully conscious of his need of those things by which
        the soul is refreshed, supported and strengthened]; and whoever
        [earnestly] desires to do it, let him come, take, appropiate, and drink
        the water of Life without cost." Revelation 22:17

      <h2>HOW TO DISCERN THE WILL OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE</h2>
      <p>
        You will have peace in your heart, and there will be no uncertainty.

          Ex. 33:14-15 - The LORD replied, “My Presence will go with you, and I
          will give you rest.” Then Moses said to him, “If your Presence does
          not go with us, do not send us up from here.

        <h3>7 IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN IMPORTANT DECISIONS:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Desire.</b>
            <p>
              Ps. 37:4 - "Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He will give
              you the desires and secret petitions of your heart."
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Confirmation by Rhema word</b>
            <p>
              Ask God for a confirmation by two or three others, who don't know
              anything about it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Supernatural revelation</b>
            <p>
              Prophecy, tongues, interpretation of tongues, dreams, visions.
              These will be a confirmation of what the Lord has already given
              you. Ask God to confirm through two or three others, who don't
              know anything about it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Spiritual leaders</b>
            <p>
              Share what you have received with spiritual leaders. Does it
              witness with them and get them to pray with you?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Common sense and wisdom.</b></li>
          <li>
            <b>Circumstances coming in line.</b>
            <p>
              Things can suddenly fall in place, sometimes even only at the last
              minute, so that the Lord can teach you to walk by faith, and not
              by sight.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Peace.</b>
            <p>You know that, the peach that passes all understanding.</p>
            <p>
              Phil 4:7 - And the peace of God, which transcends all
              understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ
              Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>1 Thess. 5:21 - but test them all; hold on to what is good,</p>
          </li>

      <h3>THE BRIDE OF CHRIST</h3>
      <p>The woman of Proverbs 31 can only be possible in Christ Jesus</p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Prov. 31:10 - A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far
          more than rubies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 12:4 - A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown, but a
          disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Cor. 11:7 - A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image
          and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 18:22 - He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives
          favor from the LORD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gen. 1:26-27 - Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in
          our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the
          birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and
          over all the creatures that move along the ground.” So God created
          mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male
          and female he created them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb. 1:2 - but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom
          he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the
          universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 19:14 - Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a
          prudent wife is from the LORD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 104:30 - When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you
          renew the face of the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Col. 3:9-10 - Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your
          old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is
          being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          James 3:8-9 - but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless
          evil, full of deadly poison. With the tongue we praise our Lord and
          Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made in God’s
          likeness.
        </p>

      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Prov. 31:11(Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing
          of value.) - Trust in the Lord's protection for every circumstance
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:12(She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.)
          - Do you do your spouse only good?
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:13(She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.) -
          The spiritual meaning of wool = striving and of flax = righteousness.
          You need to flow and mixture of both, as well as being led by the Holy
          Spirit
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:14(She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from
          afar.) - She is like the merchant ships, bringing her family food as
          well as spiritual nourishment
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:15(She gets up while it is still night; she provides food for
          her family and portions for her female servants.) - She is filled with
          the spiritual food of His Word. She rises while it is still night to
          study His Word. The maids are angels sent by God to support, protect
          and help us. Job 23:12 - "I have not departed from the commands of his
          lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily
          bread." Song of Solomon 8:12 - "But my own vineyard is mine to give;
          the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon, and two hundred are for
          those who tend its fruit."
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:16(She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she
          plants a vineyard.) - God directs her where to work. "Where You want
          to use me, there it will be fruitful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:17(She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong
          for her tasks.) - She is ready for spiritual warfar, psycholigically
          and physically fit and ready. Ps18
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:18(She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does
          not go out at night.) - Night represents problems, fustration, sorrow,
          depression, fear, doubt and distrust. Do you keep your "lamp" burning
          through these times? Night and darkness is where there is an absence
          of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:19(In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle
          with her fingers.) - Spindle - She is righteous, led by the Holy
          Spirit and her salvation is in the fear of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:20-21(She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to
          the needy. When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all
          of them are clothed in scarlet.) - Scarlet refers to being covered by
          the blood of Jesus. Snow - lack of warmth and love. She does not fear
          death, or the cold. Heb 9:19-22 - "When Moses had proclaimed every
          command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves,
          together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and
          sprinkled the scroll and all the people. He said, “This is the blood
          of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.” In the same
          way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything
          used in its ceremonies. In fact, the law requires that nearly
          everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood
          there is no forgiveness." Josh, 2:18-19 - "unless, when we enter the
          land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you
          let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your
          brothers and all your family into your house. If any of them go
          outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own
          heads; we will not be responsible. As for those who are in the house
          with you, their blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on them."
          Job 1:5 - "When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would
          make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he
          would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps
          my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was
          Job’s regular custom."
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:22(She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine
          linen and purple.) - Rev 3:5 -"The one who is victorious will, like
          them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that
          person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my
          Father and his angels." 1 Tim 2:9 - "I also want the women to dress
          modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with
          elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with
          good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God." Isa.
          61:10 - "I delight greatly in the LORD; my soul rejoices in my God.
          For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a
          robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a
          priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels." Rev. 19:8, 14
          - "Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.” (Fine linen
          stands for the righteous acts of God’s holy people.)" 14 The armies of
          heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine
          linen, white and clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:23(Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes
          his seat among the elders of the land.) - She is her husband's helper,
          and encourages him to take his place as prophet, priest and king, his
          place of authority in Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:24(She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the
          merchants with sashes.) - She is an evangelist and helps others to
          find their identity in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:26(She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her
          tongue.) - What comes out when you speak? Are your words sprinkled
          with salt?
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 31:27(She watches over the affairs of her household and does not
          eat the bread of idleness.) - The bread of idleness - she says NO to
          gossip, discontent and self-pity. 1 Tim. 5:14 - "So I counsel younger
          widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give
          the enemy no opportunity for slander." , Phil. 4:8 - "Finally,
          brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is
          right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if
          anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.", Titus
          2:5 - "to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind,
          and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the
          word of God.", Prov. 31:28-31 - "Her children arise and call her
          blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: “Many women do noble
          things, but you surpass them all.” Charm is deceptive, and beauty is
          fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. Honor her
          for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise
          at the city gate."

      <div class="content-container_box">
        <h4>(Footnote of Amplified Bible)</h4>
        <p>
          It is unfortunate that this description of God's ideal woman is
          ussually confined in readers' minds merely to its literal sense - her
          ablility as a homemaker, as in the picture of Martha of Bethany in
          Luke 10:38-42 - "As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came
          to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She
          had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what
          he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to
          be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my
          sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”
          “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about
          many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has
          chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”. But
          it is obvious that far more than that is meant. When the summary of
          what makes her value 'far above rubies' is given (in Prov. 31:30), it
          is her spiritual life only that is mentioned. One can almost hear the
          voice of Jesus saying, 'Mary has chosen the good portion...which shall
          not be taken away from her'. 'Many daughters have done...nobly and
          well...but you excel them all.' What a glowing description here
          recorded of this woman in private life, this 'capable, intelligent,
          and virtuous woman' of Prov. 31! It means she has done more than
          Mariam, the one who led a nation's women in praise to God(Exod.
          15:20,12 - "Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, took a timbrel in
          her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing.
          Miriam sang to them: “Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. Both
          horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.”"); Deborah, the
          patriotic military advisor(Judg. 4:4-10 - "Now Deborah, a prophet, the
          wife of Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that time. She held court
          under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country
          of Ephraim, and the Israelites went up to her to have their disputes
          decided. She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and
          said to him, “The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you: ‘Go, take
          with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them up to
          Mount Tabor. I will lead Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with
          his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your
          hands. ’” Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I will go; but if you
          don’t go with me, I won’t go.” “Certainly I will go with you,” said
          Deborah. “But because of the course you are taking, the honor will not
          be yours, for the LORD will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman.”
          So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh. There Barak summoned Zebulun and
          Naphtali, and ten thousand men went up under his command. Deborah also
          went up with him."); Ruth, the woman of constancy (Ruth 1:16 -"But
          Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you.
          Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people
          will be my people and your God my God."); Hannah, the ideal mother (1
          Sam 1:20, "So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave
          birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, “Because I asked the
          LORD for him.” 1 Sam 2:19 - "Each year his mother made him a little
          robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the
          annual sacrifice."); the Shunammite, the hospitable woman (2 Kings
          4:8-10 - 'One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was
          there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he
          stopped there to eat. She said to her husband, “I know that this man
          who often comes our way is a holy man of God. Let’s make a small room
          on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for
          him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us.”'); Huldah, the
          woman who revealed God's secret message to national leaders (2 Kings
          22:14 - 'Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Akbor, Shaphan and Asaiah went to
          speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of
          Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in
          Jerusalem, in the New Quarter.'); and even more than Queen Esther, the
          woman who risked sacrificing her life for her people (Esth. 4:16 -
          '“Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me.
          Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants
          will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even
          though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.”'). In what
          way did she 'excel them all'? In her spiritual and practical devotion
          to God, which permeated every area and relationship of her life. All
          seven of the Christian virtues (2 Peter 1:5-7 - 'For this very reason,
          make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness,
          knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control,
          perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual
          affection; and to mutual affection, love.') are there, like colored
          threads in a tapestry. Her secret, which is open to everyone, is the
          Holy Spirit's climax to the story, and to this book. In Prov. 31:30,
          it becomes clear that the "reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord"
          which is "the beginning (the chief and choice part) of Wisdow"(Prov.
          9:10), is put forth as the true foundation for a life which is valued
          by God and her husband as "far above rubies or pearls(Prov. 31:10)." "
