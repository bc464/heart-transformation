          1 Pet. 3:1-6 - Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own
          husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be
          won over without words by the behavior of their wives, when they see
          the purity and reverence of your lives. Your beauty should not come
          from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing
          of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your
          inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is
          of great worth in God’s sight. For this is the way the holy women of
          the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They
          submitted themselves to their own husbands, like Sarah, who obeyed
          Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what
          is right and do not give way to fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gen 3:16 - To the woman he said, “I will make your pains in
          childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to
          children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over
          you. ”
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke 22:25-26 - Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it
          over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves
          Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest
          among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the
          one who serves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph. 5:21-24, 33 - Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
          Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.
          For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the
          church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits
          to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in
          everything. 33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he
          loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
        </p>
        <p>
          Col. 3:18-19 - Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is
          fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh
          with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rom 13:1-5 - Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for
          there is no authority except that which God has established. The
          authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently,
          whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has
          instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For
          rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do
          wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then
          do what is right and you will be commended. For the one in authority
          is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for
          rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants,
          agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is
          necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible
          punishment but also as a matter of conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jer. 17:9 - The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure.
          Who can understand it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Rom. 6:6-8 - For we know that our old self was crucified with him so
          that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no
          longer be slaves to sin — because anyone who has died has been set
          free from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will
          also live with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb. 13:17 - Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their
          authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an
          account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for
          that would be of no benefit to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Pet. 2:13-17 - Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human
          authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to
          governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to
          commend those who do right. For it is God’s will that by doing good
          you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. Live as free
          people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as
          God’s slaves. Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of
          believers, fear God, honor the emperor.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Pet. 5:1-5 - To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and
          a witness of Christ’s sufferings who also will share in the glory to
          be revealed: Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care,
          watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing,
          as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to
          serve; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples
          to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive
          the crown of glory that will never fade away. In the same way, you who
          are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe
          yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God opposes the
          proud but shows favor to the humble.”

          "It is so easy to be cowardly - sometimes a very docile person may use
          the covering of saying she is submissive but really what she is doing
          is copping out when she ought to speak up as she ought to, to her
          husband - to be submissive does not mean that we do not speak up and
          give our opinion or never state what is important to have - this is a

          Bill Gothard brings out in the Advanced Basic Youth Conflicts semiar
          the way one is to appeal to authority. We will adapt this to a wife
          approaching her husband when he asks unreasonable things of her, or to
          any authorities, e.g. (Boss at work or spiritual leaders, parents).
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>They must have a genuine love and respect for him.</li>
          <li>They must have taken care of their bitterness.</li>
          <li>They must come with a learner;s heart.</li>
          <li>They must be loyal to him, trustworthy.</li>
          <li>
            They must appeal to the good in him such as "I know you want the
            best for me and our family, therefore... Not from the posistion 'You
            are so demanding so hateful, or unreasonable.'"
          </li>
          <li>
            They must come with accurate information, accurate with the facts.
            (Too often women make whole stories around a few points and jump to
            false conslusions).
          </li>
          <li>
            Be careful of the wording. Do not use language that blames, accuses
            or projects failure - all of which threatens him and his position.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then lastly, they must trust God to work through the authority
            figure, accepting what God will do in him and through him. Many
            times, time is needed to let the new idea 'sink' in or for him to
            change his mind and still maintain dignity.

          A husband, or an authority figure, as the authority, has radar built
          in to catch attitudes. There is a real need for us to know how pure
          our own heart is, before we point the finger at him. If our attitude
          is not correct, we must stop at step one, until we ourselves are right
          with God before expecting more out of him than we do ourselves. God is
          a God of Wisdom and Creativity. He alone will give common sense and
          good judgement. When a wife will approach her husband in love and
          attentiveness, then God will bring out options that neither party had
          thought about. Give God an opportunity to work in your family. One
          lade said, "Submission is yielded actions coupled with complete
          individuality."

              <p>
                Luke 9:10-17 - When the apostles returned, they reported to
                Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they
                withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, but the
                crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and
                spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who
                needed healing. Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and
                said, “Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding
                villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we
                are in a remote place here.” He replied, “You give them
                something to eat.” They answered, “We have only five loaves of
                bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this
                crowd.” (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his
                disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”
                The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. Taking the five
                loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks
                and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute
                to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the
                disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were
                left over.

                Luke 4:38-41 - Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of
                Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high
                fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. So he bent over her and
                rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began
                to wait on them. At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who
                had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one,
                he healed them. Moreover, demons came out of many people,
                shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and
                would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the
                Messiah.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matt. 8:14-17 - When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw
                Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her
                hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on
                him. When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were
                brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and
                healed all the sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken through
                the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and bore our
                diseases.”

                Mark 1:29-34 - As soon as they left the synagogue, they went
                with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. Simon’s
                mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told
                Jesus about her. So he went to her, took her hand and helped her
                up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. That
                evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick
                and demon-possessed. The whole town gathered at the door, and
                Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out
                many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they
                knew who he was.

                John 13:1-7 - It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus
                knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go
                to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he
                loved them to the end. The evening meal was in progress, and the
                devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to
                betray Jesus. Jesus knew that the Father had put all things
                under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning
                to God; so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing,
                and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured
                water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying
                them with the towel that was wrapped around him. He came to
                Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my
                feet?” Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing,
                but later you will understand.”

                the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods

                and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” For he and
                all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had
                taken, and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s
                partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid; from now
                on you will fish for people.”

                Luke 12:35-48 - “Be dressed ready for service and keep your
                lamps burning, like servants waiting for their master to return
                from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they
                can immediately open the door for him. It will be good for those
                servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I
                tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline
                at the table and will come and wait on them. It will be good for
                those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes
                in the middle of the night or toward daybreak. But understand
                this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief
                was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You
                also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour
                when you do not expect him.” Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling
                this parable to us, or to everyone?” The Lord answered, “Who
                then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in
                charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the
                proper time? It will be good for that servant whom the master
                finds doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put
                him in charge of all his possessions. But suppose the servant
                says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time in coming,’
                and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and
                women, and to eat and drink and get drunk. The master of that
                servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an
                hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign
                him a place with the unbelievers. “The servant who knows the
                master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what the
                master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who
                does not know and does things deserving punishment will be
                beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much,
                much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted
                with much, much more will be asked.

                over to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and
                set out. As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on
                the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in
                great danger. The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master,
                Master, we’re going to drown!” He got up and rebuked the wind
                and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.
                “Where is your faith?” he asked his disciples. In fear and
                amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even
                the winds and the water, and they obey him.”

                to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” He said to them,
                “When you pray, say: “‘Father, hallowed be your name, your

                something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power
                and authority of the governor. So the spies questioned him:
                “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and
                that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in
                accordance with the truth. Is it right for us to pay taxes to
                Caesar or not?” He saw through their duplicity and said to them,
                “Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?”
                “Caesar’s,” they replied. He said to them, “Then give back to
                Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” They were
                unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And
                astonished by his answer, they became silent.

                made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the
                servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out
                what they had gained with it. “The first one came and said,
                ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’ “‘Well done, my good
                servant!’ his master replied. ‘Because you have been trustworthy
                in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’ “The second
                came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five more.’ “His
                master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’ “Then another
                servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it
                laid away in a piece of cloth. I was afraid of you, because you
                are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap
                what you did not sow.’ “His master replied, ‘I will judge you by
                your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am
                a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I
                did not sow? Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so
                that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?’
                “Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away from him
                and give it to the one who has ten minas.’ “‘Sir,’ they said,
                ‘he already has ten!’ “He replied, ‘I tell you that to everyone
                who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing,
                even what they have will be taken away. But those enemies of
