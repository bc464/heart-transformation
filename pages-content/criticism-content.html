          Eph. 4:29-20 - Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your
          mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to
          their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. And do not grieve
          the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of
          redemption.

        <p>
          James 1:19-21, 26 - My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this:
          Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become
          angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God
          desires. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so
          prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save
          you. 26 - Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep
          a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion
          is worthless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hab. 2:1 - I will stand at my watch and station myself on the
          ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I
          am to give to this complaint.
        </p>

          Matt. 12:36-37 - But I tell you that everyone will have to give
          account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
          For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be
          condemned.”

        <p>
          James 3:5-18 - Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but
          it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by
          a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the
          parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course
          of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. All kinds of
          animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have
          been tamed by mankind, but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a
          restless evil, full of deadly poison. With the tongue we praise our
          Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made
          in God’s likeness. Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My
          brothers and sisters, this should not be. Can both fresh water and
          salt water flow from the same spring? My brothers and sisters, can a
          fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt
          spring produce fresh water. Two Kinds of Wisdom Who is wise and
          understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds
          done in the humility that comes from wisdom. But if you harbor bitter
          envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or
          deny the truth. Such “wisdom” does not come down from heaven but is
          earthly, unspiritual, demonic. For where you have envy and selfish
          ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice. But the
          wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving,
          considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and
          sincere. Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.

          Luke 6:43-49 - “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear
          good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not
          pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. A good man brings
          good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man
          brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the
          mouth speaks what the heart is full of. The Wise and Foolish Builders
          6:47-49pp — Mt 7:24-27 “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not
          do what I say? As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and
          puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are
          like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation
          on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could
          not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my
          words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a
          house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent
          struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 4:23 - Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do
          flows from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt. 7:18-27 - A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree
          cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is
          cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will
          recognize them. True and False Disciples “Not everyone who says to me,
          ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who
          does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on
          that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your
          name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ Then I
          will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you
          evildoers!’ The Wise and Foolish Builders 7:24-27pp — Lk 6:47-49
          “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into
          practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain
          came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that
          house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.
          But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into
          practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain
          came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that
          house, and it fell with a great crash.”

          Prov. 18:20-21 - From the fruit of their mouth a person’s stomach is
          filled; with the harvest of their lips they are satisfied. The tongue
          has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its
          fruit.

          Isa. 58:9 - Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry

          oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk,

          Matt. 7:3-5 - “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your
          brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How
          can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’
          when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite,
          first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see
          clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

          Acts 15:16-17 - “‘After this I will return and rebuild David’s fallen
          tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it, that the rest
          of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who bear my name,

          up through the Negev and on into the hill country. See what the land
          is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few
          or many. What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What
          kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified? How is
          the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your
          best to bring back some of the fruit of the land. ” (It was the season
          for the first ripe grapes.) So they went up and explored the land from
          the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath. They went up
          through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and
          Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven
          years before Zoan in Egypt.) When they reached the Valley of Eshkol,
          they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them
          carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and
          figs. That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the
          cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there. At the end of forty
          days they returned from exploring the land. Report on the Exploration
          They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at
          Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the
          whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land. They gave Moses
          this account: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does
          flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. But the people who live
          there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We
          even saw descendants of Anak there. The Amalekites live in the Negev;
          the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the
          Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan. ” Then Caleb
          silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take
          possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.” But the men who
          had gone up with him said, “We can’t attack those people; they are
          stronger than we are.” And they spread among the Israelites a bad
          report about the land they had explored. They said, “The land we
          explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are
          of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come
          from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and
          we looked the same to them.”

          1 Cor. 3:11 - For no one can lay any foundation other than the one

          Isa. 44:8(b) - Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim
          this and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God
          besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb. 10:35-39 - So do not throw away your confidence; it will be
          richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you have done the
          will of God, you will receive what he has promised. For, “In just a
          little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay.” And,
          “But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in
          the one who shrinks back.” But we do not belong to those who shrink
          back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.

          Proverns 26:2 "Like the sparrow in her wandering, like the swallow in

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If the criticism is true...be honest and humble enough to
            acknowledge it, and do something positive about it. Gal 5:22 -
            self-control is the fruit of the spirit - first step to maturity
          </li>
          <li>
            If the criticism is partially true...ask the Lord to give you
            discernment to differentiate between true and false accusations and
            ignore the untrue. Deal with that which is true. Even ask the person
            criticizing you to help you overcome the problem.
            <p>
              Prov 12:1 - "To learn you must want to be taught. To refuse
              reproof is stupid."

            <p>
              Prov. 15:31-32 - "If you profit from constructive criticism you
              will be elected to wise men's hall of fame. But to reject
              criticism is to harm yourself and your own best interests."
            </p>
            <p>
              Prov. 12:16 - Fools show their annoyance at once, but the prudent

            don't become defensive. As we are secure in the Lord, we will be

          2 Cor. 5:14-21 - For Christ’s love compels us, because we are
          convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he died
          for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but
          for him who died for them and was raised again. So from now on we
          regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded
          Christ in this way, we do so no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in
          Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!
          All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and
          gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the
          world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them.
          And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are
          therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal
          through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.
          God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might
          become the righteousness of God.

      <h2>"GIVING AND RECEIVING AN EVIL REPORT"</h2>
      <p><i>(Notes taken from Don Stephen's talk)</i></p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          I am going to talk about what is an evil report and who are carriers
          of an evil report and what the effects of an evil report are. It is
          meat to my soul. Three months ago I went to a minister's seminar and
          two hours were spent on the subject - an evil report. It so answered
          some of the need's I've had in my life and put so many things
          together. I found I was a carrier of evil reports and a receiver of
          evil report and I didn't even know what they were, and I saw the hurt
          it was causing in the Body of Christ. It's a major cause of the hurts
          and wounds in the Body of Christ today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evil report involves a distortion of the facts or incomplete facts or
          even facts which you had no right to give - unauthorized facts; or
          facts given with the wrong motive. And when we do any of these things,
          they can cause people to come to an inaccurate conclusion and they'll
          respond in an unscriptural basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evil report is so destructive it can separate long lasting friends.
          All of you have one or two close friends? You think how long it has
          taken you to develop that friendship. Proverbs 16:28 tells us that a
          whisper or gossip separate close friends. Now, you think of the hurts
          when a wisper, a bearer of evil report, separate a friendship you've
          worked on for so long.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several stages in which the body receives evil or sickness
          into it. We'll look at the physical stages and then some of the
          spiritual stages, which woud be paralled here.

      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <h3>IGNORANCE</h3>
        <p>
          The first stage in the body is what we'll call ignorance. You don't
          even know you are in the presence of carriers of a terrible germ. Now,
          for example, you can come to someone with a highly contagious disease
          but if you're notaware of it - that is the stage of ignorance; and
          you've not put this person into an isolation ward in the hospital -
          you've not isolated the germ. The minute you come into contact with
          them, that is the exposure stage. Your body is exposed to those
          infected and in fact you're in the first stage of infection and that
          infection leads to contamination. Your body becomes contaminated and
          you, yourself, become a carrier. So you are really infected, and if
          infected, you're a carrier of this disease. Lastly, this diseace
          begins to destroy the life support functions of your body.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we'll look at the stages of ignorance, then, exposure to evil
          report; when you become a carrier of evil report; and the destructive
          effects evil report has on the Body of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Corinthians 2:11
          <i
            >"Don't be ignorant of the ways of the enemy or he will gain an
            advantage over us."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignorance is when we're not aware of the destructive power of
          distorted words. We're not truly aware of how hurtful words can be. If
          you give me a choice whether I can take a physical blow or a verbal
          blow from someone who can really hurt me with words, I'll take the
          physical blow any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Words can cause hurts so deep within us that we can spend hours, even
          years, trying to suppress the memory of those words. And that is why
          Proverbs says, "He who rules his own spirit is stronger than he who
          controls a city." If you rule and control your own spirit, you are
          not, in a moment of anger, going to lash out or hurt people with your
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we're got to come over this ignorant stage and understand how
          important it is how we speak and what we say. We are all very
          susceptible to what people think and what they say to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of us has a need to be loved and to be accepted. That is a God
          given need that is put in us. It can be met either through God Himself
          or through the world around us. That is why we have some of the things
          we do in the media today, where people are living for acceptance and
          world acclaim. It is a need within people which is being met by the
          world, other than the way God intended it to be met. Heavenly Father,
          I pray that each one of us might know how precious we are in your
          sight. The Tongue! Oh! That we can watch the tongue!

          Men, when the Bible speaks to us particularly, in the New Testament
          and also in Proverbs, when it speak to men to guard their ways, it is
          normally speaking to us to guard our thougth life and to be morally
          pure.

          And when it speaks to the ladies, what does the word normally have to
          say to them? To guard the tongue, saying, "Ladies, you're more
          susceptible to this than we are."
        </p>

          Look at James 3:6 "And the tongue is a fire, the very world of
          iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles
          the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set
          on fire by hell."
