          Eph. 4:29-20 - Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your
          mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to
          their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. And do not grieve
          the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of
          redemption.

        <p>
          James 1:19-21, 26 - My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this:
          Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become
          angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God
          desires. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so
          prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save
          you. 26 - Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep
          a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion
          is worthless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hab. 2:1 - I will stand at my watch and station myself on the
          ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I
          am to give to this complaint.
        </p>

          Matt. 12:36-37 - But I tell you that everyone will have to give
          account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
          For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be
          condemned.”

        <p>
          James 3:5-18 - Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but
          it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by
          a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the
          parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course
          of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. All kinds of
          animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have
          been tamed by mankind, but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a
          restless evil, full of deadly poison. With the tongue we praise our
          Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made
          in God’s likeness. Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My
          brothers and sisters, this should not be. Can both fresh water and
          salt water flow from the same spring? My brothers and sisters, can a
          fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt
          spring produce fresh water. Two Kinds of Wisdom Who is wise and
          understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds
          done in the humility that comes from wisdom. But if you harbor bitter
          envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or
          deny the truth. Such “wisdom” does not come down from heaven but is
          earthly, unspiritual, demonic. For where you have envy and selfish
          ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice. But the
          wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving,
          considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and
          sincere. Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.

          Luke 6:43-49 - “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear
          good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not
          pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. A good man brings
          good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man
          brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the
          mouth speaks what the heart is full of. The Wise and Foolish Builders
          6:47-49pp — Mt 7:24-27 “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not
          do what I say? As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and
          puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are
          like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation
          on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could
          not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my
          words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a
          house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent
          struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 4:23 - Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do
          flows from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt. 7:18-27 - A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree
          cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is
          cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will
          recognize them. True and False Disciples “Not everyone who says to me,
          ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who
          does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on
          that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your
          name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ Then I
          will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you
          evildoers!’ The Wise and Foolish Builders 7:24-27pp — Lk 6:47-49
          “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into
          practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain
          came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that
          house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.
          But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into
          practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain
          came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that
          house, and it fell with a great crash.”

          Prov. 18:20-21 - From the fruit of their mouth a person’s stomach is
          filled; with the harvest of their lips they are satisfied. The tongue
          has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its
          fruit.

          Isa. 58:9 - Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry

          oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk,

          Matt. 7:3-5 - “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your
          brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How
          can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’
          when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite,
          first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see
          clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

          Acts 15:16-17 - “‘After this I will return and rebuild David’s fallen
          tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it, that the rest
          of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who bear my name,

          up through the Negev and on into the hill country. See what the land
          is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few
          or many. What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What
          kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified? How is
          the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your
          best to bring back some of the fruit of the land. ” (It was the season
          for the first ripe grapes.) So they went up and explored the land from
          the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath. They went up
          through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and
          Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven
          years before Zoan in Egypt.) When they reached the Valley of Eshkol,
          they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them
          carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and
          figs. That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the
          cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there. At the end of forty
          days they returned from exploring the land. Report on the Exploration
          They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at
          Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the
          whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land. They gave Moses
          this account: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does
          flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. But the people who live
          there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We
          even saw descendants of Anak there. The Amalekites live in the Negev;
          the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the
          Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan. ” Then Caleb
          silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take
          possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.” But the men who
          had gone up with him said, “We can’t attack those people; they are
          stronger than we are.” And they spread among the Israelites a bad
          report about the land they had explored. They said, “The land we
          explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are
          of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come
          from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and
          we looked the same to them.”

          1 Cor. 3:11 - For no one can lay any foundation other than the one

          Isa. 44:8(b) - Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim
          this and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God
          besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Heb. 10:35-39 - So do not throw away your confidence; it will be
          richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you have done the
          will of God, you will receive what he has promised. For, “In just a
          little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay.” And,
          “But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in
          the one who shrinks back.” But we do not belong to those who shrink
          back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.

          Proverns 26:2 "Like the sparrow in her wandering, like the swallow in

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If the criticism is true...be honest and humble enough to
            acknowledge it, and do something positive about it. Gal 5:22 -
            self-control is the fruit of the spirit - first step to maturity
          </li>
          <li>
            If the criticism is partially true...ask the Lord to give you
            discernment to differentiate between true and false accusations and
            ignore the untrue. Deal with that which is true. Even ask the person
            criticizing you to help you overcome the problem.
            <p>
              Prov 12:1 - "To learn you must want to be taught. To refuse
              reproof is stupid."

            <p>
              Prov. 15:31-32 - "If you profit from constructive criticism you
              will be elected to wise men's hall of fame. But to reject
              criticism is to harm yourself and your own best interests."
            </p>
            <p>
              Prov. 12:16 - Fools show their annoyance at once, but the prudent

            don't become defensive. As we are secure in the Lord, we will be

          2 Cor. 5:14-21 - For Christ’s love compels us, because we are
          convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he died
          for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but
          for him who died for them and was raised again. So from now on we
          regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded
          Christ in this way, we do so no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in
          Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!
          All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and
          gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the
          world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them.
          And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are
          therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal
          through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.
          God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might
          become the righteousness of God.

      <h2>"GIVING AND RECEIVING AN EVIL REPORT"</h2>
      <p><i>(Notes taken from Don Stephen's talk)</i></p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          I am going to talk about what is an evil report and who are carriers
          of an evil report and what the effects of an evil report are. It is
          meat to my soul. Three months ago I went to a minister's seminar and
          two hours were spent on the subject - an evil report. It so answered
          some of the need's I've had in my life and put so many things
          together. I found I was a carrier of evil reports and a receiver of
          evil report and I didn't even know what they were, and I saw the hurt
          it was causing in the Body of Christ. It's a major cause of the hurts
          and wounds in the Body of Christ today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evil report involves a distortion of the facts or incomplete facts or
          even facts which you had no right to give - unauthorized facts; or
          facts given with the wrong motive. And when we do any of these things,
          they can cause people to come to an inaccurate conclusion and they'll
          respond in an unscriptural basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evil report is so destructive it can separate long lasting friends.
          All of you have one or two close friends? You think how long it has
          taken you to develop that friendship. Proverbs 16:28 tells us that a
          whisper or gossip separate close friends. Now, you think of the hurts
          when a wisper, a bearer of evil report, separate a friendship you've
          worked on for so long.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several stages in which the body receives evil or sickness
          into it. We'll look at the physical stages and then some of the
          spiritual stages, which woud be paralled here.

      </div>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <h3>IGNORANCE</h3>
        <p>
          The first stage in the body is what we'll call ignorance. You don't
          even know you are in the presence of carriers of a terrible germ. Now,
          for example, you can come to someone with a highly contagious disease
          but if you're notaware of it - that is the stage of ignorance; and
          you've not put this person into an isolation ward in the hospital -
          you've not isolated the germ. The minute you come into contact with
          them, that is the exposure stage. Your body is exposed to those
          infected and in fact you're in the first stage of infection and that
          infection leads to contamination. Your body becomes contaminated and
          you, yourself, become a carrier. So you are really infected, and if
          infected, you're a carrier of this disease. Lastly, this diseace
          begins to destroy the life support functions of your body.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we'll look at the stages of ignorance, then, exposure to evil
          report; when you become a carrier of evil report; and the destructive
          effects evil report has on the Body of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Corinthians 2:11
          <i
            >"Don't be ignorant of the ways of the enemy or he will gain an
            advantage over us."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignorance is when we're not aware of the destructive power of
          distorted words. We're not truly aware of how hurtful words can be. If
          you give me a choice whether I can take a physical blow or a verbal
          blow from someone who can really hurt me with words, I'll take the
          physical blow any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Words can cause hurts so deep within us that we can spend hours, even
          years, trying to suppress the memory of those words. And that is why
          Proverbs says, "He who rules his own spirit is stronger than he who
          controls a city." If you rule and control your own spirit, you are
          not, in a moment of anger, going to lash out or hurt people with your
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we're got to come over this ignorant stage and understand how
          important it is how we speak and what we say. We are all very
          susceptible to what people think and what they say to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of us has a need to be loved and to be accepted. That is a God
          given need that is put in us. It can be met either through God Himself
          or through the world around us. That is why we have some of the things
          we do in the media today, where people are living for acceptance and
          world acclaim. It is a need within people which is being met by the
          world, other than the way God intended it to be met. Heavenly Father,
          I pray that each one of us might know how precious we are in your
          sight. The Tongue! Oh! That we can watch the tongue!
        </p>
        <p>
          Men, when the Bible speaks to us particularly, in the New Testament
          and also in Proverbs, when it speak to men to guard their ways, it is
          normally speaking to us to guard our thougth life and to be morally
          pure.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when it speaks to the ladies, what does the word normally have to
          say to them? To guard the tongue, saying, "Ladies, you're more
          susceptible to this than we are."
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at James 3:6 "And the tongue is a fire, the very world of
          iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles
          the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set
          on fire by hell."

        <h4>SOME STAGES OF IGNORANCE</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            IGNORANCE OF HOW WORDS DESTROY CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS.
            <p>
              Proverbs 17:9 "He who covers transgression seeks love, but he who
              repeats a matter separates intimate friends."
            </p>
            <p>
              Can we, as members of the Body of Christ, be those who cover
              others' sins? I know when people have truly sinned and they've
              come and they've asked for forgiveness and they've repented, that
              is the time when we cover it up. I'm not referring to covering
              people's sins who haven't confessed them and made it right with
              God; but we should not be those who spread people's wrongs all
              over the place. Be loyal to one another's weakness: Love covers
              and protects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I'm not talking about being naive. I'm not talking about
              hiding some great evil in a corner, but when sin has been exposed
              and has been dealt with then we cover. Love covers.
            </p>
            <p>LET US BE THOSE WHO ARE CLOSE-MOUTHED.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            WE ARE IGNORANCE OF HOW THE UNCLEAN DEFILES THE CLEAN.
            <p>
              It is always that way. The Old Testament is full of examples where
              if you have the clean and place the unclean with it, the clean
              becomes unclean.
              <i
                >Haggai 2:13,14 said, 'Then Haggai said, “If a person defiled by
                contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it
                become defiled?” “Yes,” the priests replied, “it becomes
                defiled. ” Then Haggai said, “‘So it is with this people and
                this nation in my sight,’ declares the LORD. ‘Whatever they do
                and whatever they offer there is defiled.'</i
              >
              And so, by spreading an evil report, we contaminate what was good
              and what was clean.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            WE HAVE IGNORANCE OF WHAT CONSTITUTES AN EVIL REPORT
            <p>An evil report is:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                UNAUTHORIZED: i'd like to underscore that because so much of our
                reporting today is unauthorized. If you've not been given
                express permission by someone in a responsible position in a
                church or a denomination or work of God or in a family situation
                to communicate something, don't say it. It is unauthorized. I
                don't want people speaking fer me: I want to ecplain it myself.
                Don't we all want that? So that it is communicated rightly.
              </li>
              <li>
                IT IS DISTORTED or it is part of the facts and what it does is
                to influence us to form a worng opinion of another person,
                another work or denomination or situation, and when that
                happens, we close our spirit off to them and at that meoment we
                enter into grave sin.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            WE HAVE IGNORANCE OF HOW EVIL REPORTS ARE GIVEN.
            <p>
              They are given by words but some of the most devastating evil
              reports which I've received or given or have seen given have been
              in non-verbal communication. We can sit there very silently and
              give a terrible evil report. Or we can raise an eyebrow or give a
              look and that look says, "I discredit you completely." They can be
              subtle or very obvious. They can be quiet or very angry. They can
              be sweet or vry bittr, but it is an evil report and it doesn't
              have to be spoken - it can be non-verbally communicated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do you know that a lot of our communication of acceptance or
              rejection is non-verbal? It is very important in the communication
              of love that we have hands to reach out and touch that communicate
              warmth. Eye contact is so vry important too. This is totally off
              the subject but we need to be aware of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              You play games in your family and when you're at war with one
              another, when there's disagreement in your family, the most
              hurtful game you play is with the eye. And if you are upset, you
              rob them of eye contact. You look the other way. You'll
              communicate but lack eye contact. And through eye contact we gain
              most of our love and acceptance. It is very hurtful to rob one
              another of eye contact.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            IGNORANCE OF WHO GIVES EVIL REPORT.
            <p>
              Who gives evil report? All of us. There is not one of us who has
              not given an evil report. Lord, help us to be better in the future
              - help us all! What does God say of us when we give evil reports?
              He calls us whisperers, gossips, slanderers and busy bodies. Those
              are pretty strong words. And that is what we are when we give evil
              reports. Now just so that you get the full impact of what God
              thinks when someone's a busy-body look at 1 PETER 4:15 "By no
              means let any of you suffer as a murderer" - of course not! We
              don't want any murderers in the Body of Christ, only forgiven
              murderers! - or thief or evildoer ot a troublesome meddler. And
              two verses later - judgment must begin at the household of God.
              God puts a busy-body or a slanderer or a gossip in the same
              category as murderers.

          </li>
          <li>
            IGNORANCE OF WHAT MOTIVATES AN EVIL REPORT.
            <ul>
              <li>
                BITTERNESS - we are reacting out of personal hurts so we're
                struggling with bitterness.
              </li>
              <li>
                REBELLION - and we try to justify our rebellious independent
                spirit by telling negatives or evils of others.
              </li>
              <li>
                DECEPTION - we're blinded by our own pride and we're so deceived
                we believe it is our role in the Body of Christ to give evil
                reports of others, men and women of God and spiritual leaders:
                that is the height of deception if you think your calling in the
                Body of Christ is to give evil reports of others and other work.
                You can't get more deceitful than that.
              </li>
              <li>
                GUILT - we want to exalt ourselves and it somehow makes us feel
                important if we know something about some other group or people;
                and we are justifying some of our past actions or attitudes.
              </li>
              <li>ENVY - we are desirous of what another has.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            IGNORANCE OF HOW SUSCEPTIBLE WE ARE TO EVIL REPORTS.
            <p>
              Do you know we enjoy hearing evil reports because they exalt us?
              We think we know something about a certain group or a certain
              individual. Do you see that susceptibility in us and do you know
              what it does? And evil report brings down in our eyes those we
              dislike and it exalts us because we know something and oh! It is
              terrible in the eyes of God.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            IGNORANCE OF HOW SATAN USES EVIL REPORT.
            <p>
              He uses it to discredit spiritual leadership. Evil report causes
              Christians to close their spirits to one another. Tha tis why we
              have people in the Body of Christ who won't even speak to another,
              due to what they've heard.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we don't need to know it then don't let's know it, unless we
              might grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
              Satan uses evil report to multiply conflicts so producing more
              ungodliness. And the more people he can get involved in it the
              greater the conflict and the greater the ungodliness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Divisions and conflicts are tools and weapons in the hands of
              non-Christians to mock Christianity, because of the way we reject
              each other in the Body of Christ.

      <h3>EXPOSURE OF EVIL REPORT</h3>
      <p>
        PROVERBS 27:12 "A prudent man sees evil and hides from it; the naive
        proceed and pay the penalty."
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Well. let's be prudent as we face the things that are ahead of us in
          the future. Let me just share a story. Some of the Y.W.A.M. teams were
          in Czechhoslovakia 8 or 9 years ago, taking Bibles in and ministering
          in youth camps. There were five men, pastors, who were very close to
          one another. They had been arrested. Their interrogators were taking
          one man at a time and saying things bout them, "So and so saud this
          about you..." And these men responded to the interrogators time and
          time again, "That's not true - I know categorically it is not. First
          of all, I didn't do it and secondly he's my friend and he wouldn't say
          that about me." The interrogator heated it up saying, "The others have
          already admitted and they've implicated you. You must confess and
          admit to these wrongs." And the five answered independently, "That's
          not true. My brother wouldn't say that of me." The end result of the
          interrogator, who was a communist official, was that he called the
          five men in and said, "I've never seen love and honesty like this. I
          want to know your Jesus", and he became a Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we don't know what is going to be ahead of us. I know how you are
          praying for your land and the lands around you but in all honesty, we
          need to say we don't know what form it will take in the future. We
          know of some of the promises that God's given for this land, and how
          He wants to use you to reach out into Africa but we don't know the
          form it is going to take. And we're got to be so united and knit
          together that we can stand. An evil report will divide us before we
          ever get there. It is a great tool in the hand of the enemy. Prudent
          man hides himself.
        </p>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>EXPOSURE TO EVIL REPORT</h3>
      <p>
        This is entering into a conversation with a person who is a carier of an
        evil report. When you do this, you expose yourself, your spirit to them.
        It's like they're carrying infectious hepatitis and you don't know it

          How does God want you to repond? Psalm 101:5 says

        </p>
        <p>
          After we have exposed the carrier of an evil report in a right loving
          manner, there are some scripture which can guide us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ephesians 5:10-12 -
          <i
            >and find out what pleases the Lord. Have nothing to do with the
            fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. It is shameful
            even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.</i
          >
          Have no fellowship! Don't talk about it - these evil reports.

      <h3>THE DETECTION OF A CARRIER OF EVIL REPORT</h3>
      <p>
        And Oh! This is difficult. You see, it appeals to our pride. If we know
        something about a group of people or a certain situation, it says, "You
        are important"! I think you should know the word and the word says,
        "Avoid it".
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Now our body has mechanisms to warn us against physical contamination:
          we can smell it, see it, taste it - we can see it out there and that
          it will cause us harm, but sometimes we detect it too late.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>HOW CAN WE DETECT THIS PERSON IS A CARRIER OF AN EVIL REPORT?</h3>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <ol>
          <li>
            The carrier will usually test your spirit before giving you the evil
            report. He'll enter into the conversatio with you and there are
            certain questions they'll put to you. They're putting out feelers.
            I've been involved in it too. We've all done it and that's why I
            recognize it. They're testing your spirit and if you encourage them
            just the least little bit, they'll give you that evil report -
            they'll dump it on you and you become contaminated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              This is very closely related to the first point. The carrier will
              usually check your acceptance. Ar you susceptible to an evil
              report or not? Now this is the way they do it: they normally ask
              your opinion. "What do you think about so and so, that group, that
              sermon?" Now there's a whole group with an honest questioning mind
              who really wants to know, but there are a lot of others who check
              your acceptance, who want to see if they can feed you an evil
              report and they say, "Yes, but" and go on and share it with you.
              Or he may drop some negative comment. You may be in a conversation
              with them and they drop a negative comment and go right on, and
              they want to see how you respond and if you come around to that
              negative comment. This is part of the way we are made. Negative
              spirit reaches out to find other negative people so that they can
              deposit these reports into those who can become contaminated and
              who can destroy the Body of Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is interesting scripture and we found it so true in Yout with a
              Mission outreaches and crusades. You can have people - and I've
              watched this happen - in totally opposite social backgrounds, from
              the other end of the nation, who've never known each other but if
              they're rebellious, within an hour of their arrival at the
              crusade, they'll find each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              And there's a Bible principle for this: At the time of the
              crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, Herod and Pilate, who'd been
              enemies all their lives, when they both gave Him up to be
              crucified, they became fast friends, from that day on. It is
              called agreement in rebellion. It happens in the spirit and that
              is what people are doing when they're checking your acceptance.
              They observe how you respond to it.
