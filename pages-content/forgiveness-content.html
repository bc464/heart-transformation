      <h1>Freedom of Forgiveness</h1>
      <p>
        Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I
        forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”
        Jesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.

            <p>
              Matt 6:14-15 - For if you forgive other people when they sin
              against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if
              you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive

              Heb 9:22 - In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be

              you.” Sing for joy, you heavens, for the LORD has done this; shout

      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          Gen 50:15-21 - When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead,
          they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back
          for all the wrongs we did to him?” So they sent word to Joseph,
          saying, “Your father left these instructions before he died: ‘This is
          what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the
          sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’ Now
          please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father. ”
          When their message came to him, Joseph wept. His brothers then came
          and threw themselves down before him. “We are your slaves,” they said.
          But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
          You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish
          what is now being done, the saving of many lives. So then, don’t be
          afraid. I will provide for you and your children. ” And he reassured
          them and spoke kindly to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps 19:12-13 - But who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden
          faults. Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule
          over me. Then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps 32 - Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose
          sins are covered. Blessed is the one whose sin the LORD does not count
          against them and in whose spirit is no deceit. When I kept silent, my
          bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night
          your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of
          summer. Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my
          iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD.” And
          you forgave the guilt of my sin. Therefore let all the faithful pray
          to you while you may be found; surely the rising of the mighty waters
          will not reach them. You are my hiding place; you will protect me from
          trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. I will instruct you
          and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my
          loving eye on you. Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no
          understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will
          not come to you. Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD’s
          unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in him. Rejoice in the
          LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in

          Micah 7:18-19 - Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives
          the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay
          angry forever but delight to show mercy. You will again have
          compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our
          iniquities into the depths of the sea.

          Rom 2:4 - Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness,

          intended to lead you to repentance?

          Zech 3 - Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the
          angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him.
          The LORD said to Satan, “The LORD rebuke you, Satan! The LORD, who has
          chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched
          from the fire?” Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood
          before the angel. The angel said to those who were standing before
          him, “Take off his filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I
          have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.” Then I
          said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on
          his head and clothed him, while the angel of the LORD stood by. The
          angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua: “This is what the LORD
          Almighty says: ‘If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my
          requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my
          courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.
          “‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before
          you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my
          servant, the Branch. See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua!
          There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an
          inscription on it,’ says the LORD Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin
          of this land in a single day. “‘In that day each of you will invite
          your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree, ’ declares the LORD
          Almighty.”

          2 Cor. 2:7-11 - Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so
          that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. I urge you,
          therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. Another reason I wrote you
          was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
          Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there
          was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for
          your sake, in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not
          unaware of his schemes.

          1 John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will

        <p>
          2 Chron 6:21-39 - Hear the supplications of your servant and of your
          people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your
          dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive. “When anyone wrongs their
          neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the
          oath before your altar in this temple, then hear from heaven and act.
          Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down
          on their heads what they have done, and vindicating the innocent by
          treating them in accordance with their innocence. “When your people
          Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against
          you and when they turn back and give praise to your name, praying and
          making supplication before you in this temple, then hear from heaven
          and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the
          land you gave to them and their ancestors. “When the heavens are shut
          up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you,
          and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your name and
          turn from their sin because you have afflicted them, then hear from
          heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach
          them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your
          people for an inheritance. “When famine or plague comes to the land,
          or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when enemies besiege
          them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,
          and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people
          Israel—being aware of their afflictions and pains, and spreading out
          their hands toward this temple— then hear from heaven, your dwelling
          place. Forgive, and deal with everyone according to all they do, since
          you know their hearts (for you alone know the human heart), so that
          they will fear you and walk in obedience to you all the time they live
          in the land you gave our ancestors. “As for the foreigner who does not
          belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because
          of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when
          they come and pray toward this temple, then hear from heaven, your
          dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the
          peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own
          people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your
          Name. “When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you
          send them, and when they pray to you toward this city you have chosen
          and the temple I have built for your Name, then hear from heaven their
          prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause. “When they sin against
          you—for there is no one who does not sin —and you become angry with
          them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to a land
          far away or near; and if they have a change of heart in the land where
          they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of
          their captivity and say, ‘We have sinned, we have done wrong and acted
          wickedly’; and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul
          in the land of their captivity where they were taken, and pray toward
          the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and
          toward the temple I have built for your Name; then from heaven, your
          dwelling place, hear their prayer and their pleas, and uphold their
          cause. And forgive your people, who have sinned against you.

        <p>
          Ps 86:5 - You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in love to all
          who call to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          James 1:2-4 - Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever
          you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of
          your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so
          that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 18:19 - A brother wronged is more unyielding than a fortified
          city; disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark 11:25-26 - And when you stand praying, if you hold anything
          against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may
          forgive you your sins. But if you do not forgive others their sins,
          your Father will not forgive your sins.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Prov. 28:13 - Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the
          one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt 5:22-24 - But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother
          or sister, will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a
          brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who
          says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell. “Therefore,
          if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that
          your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift
          there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then
          come and offer your gift.

          Before Jesus died he said:
          <i>"Father for give them for they know not what they do!"</i> then He
          gave up His Spirit and entered into death. Before you and I can die to
          ourselves we need to forgive, just as Jesus did:

        <ol>
          <li>Forgive others for what they do to us.</li>
          <li>

            forgive me for my wrong attitude towards you.
            <p>
              1 Cor 16:22 - If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be

            </p>
            <p>
              Job 38 - Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm. He said:
              “Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge?
              Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall
              answer me. “Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
              Tell me, if you understand. Who marked off its dimensions? Surely
              you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it? On what were
              its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone — while the morning
              stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy? “Who shut
              up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, when I
              made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness, when
              I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place, when I
              said, ‘This far you may come and no farther; here is where your
              proud waves halt’? “Have you ever given orders to the morning, or
              shown the dawn its place, that it might take the earth by the
              edges and shake the wicked out of it? The earth takes shape like
              clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.
              The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is
              broken. “Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in
              the recesses of the deep? Have the gates of death been shown to
              you? Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness? Have you
              comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know
              all this. “What is the way to the abode of light? And where does
              darkness reside? Can you take them to their places? Do you know
              the paths to their dwellings? Surely you know, for you were
              already born! You have lived so many years! “Have you entered the
              storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail, which
              I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle? What
              is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the
              place where the east winds are scattered over the earth? Who cuts
              a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the
              thunderstorm, to water a land where no one lives, an uninhabited
              desert, to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with
              grass? Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?
              From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from
              the heavens when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface
              of the deep is frozen? “Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades?
              Can you loosen Orion’s belt? Can you bring forth the
              constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its
              cubs? Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God’s
              dominion over the earth? “Can you raise your voice to the clouds
              and cover yourself with a flood of water? Do you send the
              lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, ‘Here we
              are’? Who gives the ibis wisdom or gives the rooster
              understanding? Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip
              over the water jars of the heavens when the dust becomes hard and
              the clods of earth stick together? “Do you hunt the prey for the
              lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions when they crouch in
              their dens or lie in wait in a thicket? Who provides food for the
              raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of
              food?
            </p>

              Job 39 - Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you
              watch when the doe bears her fawn? Do you count the months till
              they bear? Do you know the time they give birth? They crouch down
              and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended. Their
              young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not
              return. “Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied its ropes? I
              gave it the wasteland as its home, the salt flats as its habitat.
              It laughs at the commotion in the town; it does not hear a
              driver’s shout. It ranges the hills for its pasture and searches
              for any green thing. “Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will
              it stay by your manger at night? Can you hold it to the furrow
              with a harness? Will it till the valleys behind you? Will you rely
              on it for its great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to
              it? Can you trust it to haul in your grain and bring it to your
              threshing floor? “The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, though
              they cannot compare with the wings and feathers of the stork. She
              lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,
              unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may
              trample them. She treats her young harshly, as if they were not
              hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain, for God did not
              endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense. Yet when
              she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.
              “Do you give the horse its strength or clothe its neck with a
              flowing mane? Do you make it leap like a locust, striking terror
              with its proud snorting? It paws fiercely, rejoicing in its
              strength, and charges into the fray. It laughs at fear, afraid of
              nothing; it does not shy away from the sword. The quiver rattles
              against its side, along with the flashing spear and lance. In
              frenzied excitement it eats up the ground; it cannot stand still
              when the trumpet sounds. At the blast of the trumpet it snorts,
              ‘Aha!’ It catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of
              commanders and the battle cry. “Does the hawk take flight by your
              wisdom and spread its wings toward the south? Does the eagle soar
              at your command and build its nest on high? It dwells on a cliff
              and stays there at night; a rocky crag is its stronghold. From
              there it looks for food; its eyes detect it from afar. Its young
              ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there it is.”

            To forgive yourself - we can be our own worst enemy by judging
            ourselves and not receiving God's forgiveness.
            <p>
              Rom 8:31-39 - What, then, shall we say in response to these
              things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not
              spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not
              also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will
              bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who
              justifies. Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus
              who died —more than that, who was raised to life —is at the right
              hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us
              from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution
              or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: “For
              your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep
              to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than
              conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that
              neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the
              present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth,
              nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us
              from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

              on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive

              clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who

          bitterness and hatred in the Name of Jesus before forgiving, release

            Make a list of people who have hurt or wronged you whom you need to
            forgive. Be specific.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make a list of things you could be holding against God. Be specific.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make a list of things yu could be holding against yourself. Be
            specific. You would first need to receive God's forgiveness for that
            thing before you can forgive yourself. Remember to always bring the
            offense or sin under the blood of Jesus.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a couple ask the Lord to show you who you would need to forgive,
            offenses towards the two of you, or your family, or as individuals.
            Pray for each other and support each other as you forgive. Think
            also - churches, ministries, organizations, towns, cities, nations,
            groups of people, schools, countries, family, friends etc
          </li>
          <li>
            If it is something that has affected your whole family - and if you
            feel that the children are ready for this - to get the children
            together and to forgive together. If children are not ready for this
            - then you as a couple could forgive on behalf of the children and
            pray for the children that they will become prepared to forgive.
          </li>
          <li>
            To forgive your husband or wife's offenses - Be specific! Whether
            they have let you down, or failed to meet your needs, or done
            something or forgotten to do something. Remember not to judge one
            another. Be patient after you have forgiven - Allow the Holy Spirit
            to work in yur partner's life - LET GO! LET GOD!! - Treat others as
            you would want them to treat you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember forgiveness is a decision of the will. God will supply the
            emotions afterwards. Allow the Holy Spirit to bring healing to your
            heart. God can heal the wounded spirit instantaneously with His
            "Balm of Gilead", or it can happen in His time and way.

          "Blessing opens the door to communications in a reactive sense. This
          may be the most radical principle of human relationships. Love is
          revolutionary, but giving a blessing for an insult is more
          incompatible with what the human nature automatically wants to do!
        </p>
        <p>Peter uses the principle of blessing to sum up all relationships:</p>
        <p>
          To sum up, let all be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly,
          kind-hearted, and humble in spirit; not returning evil for evil, or
          insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called
          for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing. For "Let him
          who means to love life and see good days refrain his togue from evil
          and his lips from speaking guile. And let him turn away from evil and
          do good; Let him seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord
          are upon the righteous, and His ears attend to their prayer, but the
          dace of the Lord is against those who do evil."(1 Peter 3:8-12)

        <h3>WHAT IS A BLESSING?</h3>
        <p>There are four ways the term is used in the Bible:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The praise of God and Christ.
            <p>
              Rev. 5:12-13 - In a loud voice they were saying: “Worthy is the
              Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and
              strength and honor and glory and praise!" Then I heard every
              creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the
              sea, and all that is in them, saying: “To him who sits on the
              throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power,
              for ever and ever!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Rev. 7:12 - saying: “Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks
              and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever.
              Amen!”
            </p>
            <p>What positive qualities in your mate can you praise?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Benefits - gifts bestowed
            <p>
              Rom. 15:29 - I know that when I come to you, I will come in the
              full measure of the blessing of Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gal. 1:3 - Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord
              Jesus Christ,
            </p>
            <p>
              What benefits can you offer your mate? In what way can you be a
              blessing to him/her?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Giving thanks to God for His gifts and favour
            <p>
              Luke 1:64 - Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set
              free, and he began to speak,
            </p>
            <p>
              Luke 2:28 - Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:
            </p>
            <p>
              Mark 6:41 - Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up
              to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them
              to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the
              two fish among them all.
            </p>
            <p>
              What qualities about your mate are you thanksful for, and how can
              you communicate this to him/her?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            To call God's favour down upon
            <p>
              Luke 6:28 - bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Matt. 21:9 - The crowds that went ahead of him and those that
              followed shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” “Blessed is he
              who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Hosanna in the highest
              heaven!”
            </p>
            <p>
              What specific areas of your mate's life should you pray that the
              Lord will bless?
            </p>
            These are the blessings that should be rendered in response to the
            insults you receive.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The principle of rendering a blessing for an insult is common
          throughout the New Testament: <br />
          Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the
          sight of all men(Rom. 12:17)
        </p>
        <p>
          See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek
          after that which is good for one another and for all men.(1 Thess.
          5:15)
        </p>
        <p>
          ...and we toil, working with our own hands; when we are reviled, we
          bless; when we are persecuted, we endure.(1 Cor. 4:12)
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. (Luke
            6:28)</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          You have heard that it was said,
          <i
            >"You shall love your neighbour, and hate your enemy." But I say to
            you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you in
            order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He
            causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on
            the righteous and the unrighteous. For if you love those who love
            you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax gatherers do the
            same? And if you greet your brothers only; what do you do more than
            others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? (Matt. 5:43-47)</i

      <h3>WHY A BLESSING?</h3>
      <p>
        Why do we need to give blessings? Why not a "righteous" jab? Rendering a
        blessing for an insult is far from normal for the average person.
        However, if God designed the family, He certainly knows what makes it
        work best.
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          As always God doesn't leave us hanging over the edge of a cliff in
          order to take a leap of faith into the cold darkness. In 1 Peter
          3:9-12 four reasons why yu should render a blessing are given.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>FIRST</b>
          <i
            >"...for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit
            a blessing"</i
          >
          (v9). The purpose of the Christian life is wrapped up in the desire of
          God that believers might enjoy the blessings of life. So a believer
          must give a blessing in order to inherit a blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>SECOND</b>
          <i
            >...let him who means to live life and see good days refrain his
            tongue from evil...</i
          >
          (v10). The one who gives the blessing instead of an insult will have
          days freen from frustration and tension. Many people are burdened down
          with heaviness broght about by wrong reactions towards others.
          Bitterness and resentment eat away at peole's insides, causing
          problems ranging from ulcers to eventual death. Giving a blessing
          lifts that burden!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>THIRD</b>
          <i
            >"For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears
            attend to their prayer...</i
          >
          (v11). The Lord will protect those who give a blessing and wll hear
          their prayers. One might tend to think that giving a blessing affords
          a perfect opportunity for a person to be taken advantage of.
        </p>
        <p>
          ("I might get stomped on if I gave a blessing.") But the promise of
          the Lord to the one giving the blessing refutes that idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point you may be wondering why Peter has failed to mention the
          repsonsibilities of the one who is persecuting you. It's intentional!
          It's more important to God that you learn how to respond to hurt in a
          godly way than for you to be delivered from the one who is hurting
          you. God wants us to view these situations as part of a learning
          experience; instead of seeing them as a prison of circumstances, we
          are to see them a opportunities to grow to maturity. However, once you
          have responded the way God wants you to by giving a blessing, God then
          promises that He will begin to deal with the mate who is hurting you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>FOURTH</b>
          <i>"...but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil"</i>
          (v12). The person who refuses to give a blessing but gives an insult
          must reckon with the Lord. The Lord will work on him! Paul sheds some
          light on this concept in Romans:
        </p>

            of God, for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says

          In order for the Lord to work on the one doing evil, you must get out
          of the way - "leave room for the wrath of God." Let God work on the
          insulter by your giving a blessing - the Lord will do a much better
          job than you could ever do.

      <h3>HOW TO GIVE A BLESSING!</h3>
      <p>
        Jesus employed four steps in responding to insult, and we are commanded
        to imitate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        1 Peter 1:21, 25 - To this you were called, because Christ suffered for
        you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. For
        “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have returned to the
        Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
      </p>
      <div class="content-container_box">
        <p>
          <b>STEP 1:</b>
          <i
            >You are to have no personal offence (“He committed no sin, and no
            deceit was found in his mouth.”v22).</i
          >
          You can't give a blessing to someone if you have unconfessed sin
          before God and between you and the offended. One evening Carol and I
          had an atgument over something. In the midst of it all Carol became
          quite upset - more than I thought the situation called for. I left the
          room to allow the scene to cool off. I then returned with a
          blessing(expressing appreciation for a quality in her life). After I
          verbalized the blessing, Carol turned and said, "If that was meant to
          be a blessing, it isn't going to work!" I couldn't believe it! I said,
          "What do you mean?". Apparently without realizing it I cut her with
          some verbal jab (it's natural for me) while we were disagreeing. What
          she was saying is, "If you think you can give a blessing to me when
          you were the original offender, you're very mistaken!" Because I had
          offended her, I was disqualified in giving out blessings?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>STEP 2:</b>
          <i
            >Purpose to render a blessing for the insult or hurt you have
            experienced (When they hurled their insults at him, he did not
            retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he
            entrusted himself to him who judges justly. (v23)). Here's where the
            will enters in - decide you are going to give a blessing when
            insulted. Creatively seek the appropriate blessing by the use of the
            folling questions:</i
          >
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i
              >What positive qualities about my mate can I praise him/her
              for?</i
            >
          </li>
          <li><i>What benefits could I bestow on my mate?</i></li>
          <li><i>In what way can I be a blessing to him/her?</i></li>
          <li><i>What qualities about my mate am I thankful for?</i></li>
          <li><i>How can I communicate this to him/her?</i></li>
          <li>
            <i
              >What specific areas of my mate's life should I pray that the Lord
              will bless him/her in?</i
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Obviously, the most difficult time to give a blessing is in the heat
          of the battle. It's probably better to walk away from the battle, for
          both to cool off emotionally. Then return with a genuine blessing.
        </p>
        <p><b>STEP 3</b> Commit yourself and the situation to the Lord. Thank Him for raising up this situation for the purpose of making you more Christ like.
        <p>Romans 8:28-29 - And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.</p>
      <p>1 Thess 5:18 - give thanks in all circumstances; for this is Gods will for you in Christ Jesus.</p>
      </p>
      <p><i>Then commit yourself to the Lord's keeping and vow to withdraw yourself from the battle so the Lord can begin to deal with your offender. Release the Lord to act by giving a blessing</i> (Romans 12:17-21 - Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for Gods wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.)</p>
      <p><b>STEP 4:</b> <i>Purpose to be willing to suffer in order to heal your offender</i> (1 Peter 2:24 - “He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.”). When you give a blessing, all may not be resolved for a period of time. In fact, you may look like the fool or be hurt because of your position of blessing. Think of Christ! What were the results Chirst achieved in following these four steps? Those who were astray returned to the Shepherd. (1 Peter 2:25 - For “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.)</p>

      <p>One woman faced with some of the worst insults I've ever witnessed gave some of the blest blessing ever given. Her husband travlled nationally as a salesman. He came home eight to twelve days per month. He told her he came home only for sex with her; but in the same breath he ralted to her his various sexual exploits around the country. Even in front of the children he mentioned these other women. It was a tragic scene! No one would have faulted her for filing for divorce. But someone got tho this woman before she did anything drastic and challenged her to heal her mate through being a blessing. It was a real test of how much she loved him. After three long years, he came home for good. Now the family is back together, better than ever before. Was it tough? It was hell on earth! Was it worth it? They couldn't be happier! When you add blessing to the principle of love, you have a "dynamic duo" which will overwhelm anyone! When your mate insults you, don't retaliate with an insult. Render a blessing, and let God deal with your mate - He'll do a much better job!</p>
